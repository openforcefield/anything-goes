# Data

This is some quick-and-dirty data aggregation from the Sage 2.2.1 training dataset and additional Cresset submissions.

* `curate-and-convert-training-data.ipynb` downloads data from QCArchive and saves it to JSONs.
* `convert-to-smee.ipynb` creates Huggingface datasets suitable for use with smee and descent.
