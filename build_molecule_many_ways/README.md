-  openff-molecule-output-lots-of-ways.ipynb:
   - A bunch of ways to build systems and output to files
     - including a single molecule (`monomer`)
     - many copies of the molecule packed in box (`monomer_packed`)
     - a molecule solvated in water (`solvated_monomer`)
     - three different molecules in a mixture together in a box (`monomer_packed`). 
   - All output files generated in GROMACS (`.gro`, `.top` suffixes, AMBER `.prmtop`, `.inpcrd`, and LAMMPS (`.lmp`).
