Scripts to generate a set of ionic liquids

The files in the tgz are:
 
 - il0 through il9 have a series of the modified imidazole IL systems.

 - des12 etc are the deep eutectic solvent files at different ratios (along with pure ethylene glycol)


 - il_neutral10, etc are the ionic liquids with tetraglyme
 
 - Note that to get packmol to run in a reasonable amount of time,
this scripts use a really big box, so there are some enormous gaps in
many of the structures that would need quite a lot of NPT
equilibration.
 
 - Also, the placement isnâ€™t smart enough to put the anions and
cations close to each other, and instead the positions are randomized;
the files have been energy minimized, but there will likely be quite a
bit of heat/box shrinkage as anions and cations get closer.
 
Note: it's known that OpenFF currently gives very high viscosities for
ionic liquds (there is no charge scaling), so be aware.
