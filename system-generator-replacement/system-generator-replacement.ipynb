With it,\\nexpressions that operate on arrays (like :code:`'3*a+4*b'`) are accelerated\\nand use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.\\n\\nIn addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your\\ncores -- which generally results in substantial performance scaling compared\\nto NumPy.\\n\\nLast but not least, numexpr can make use of Intel's VML (Vector Math\\nLibrary, normally integrated in its Math Kernel Library, or MKL).\\nThis allows further acceleration of transcendent expressions.\\n\\n\\nHow NumExpr achieves high performance\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThe main reason why NumExpr achieves better performance than NumPy is\\nthat it avoids allocating memory for intermediate results. This\\nresults in better cache utilization and reduces memory access in\\ngeneral. Due to this, NumExpr works best with large arrays.\\n\\nNumExpr parses expressions into its own op-codes that are then used by\\nan integrated computing virtual machine. The array operands are split\\ninto small chunks that easily fit in the cache of the CPU and passed\\nto the virtual machine. The virtual machine then applies the\\noperations on each chunk. It's worth noting that all temporaries and\\nconstants in the expression are also chunked. Chunks are distributed among\\nthe available cores of the CPU, resulting in highly parallelized code\\nexecution.\\n\\nThe result is that NumExpr can get the most of your machine computing\\ncapabilities for array-wise computations. Common speed-ups with regard\\nto NumPy are usually between 0.95x (for very simple expressions like\\n:code:`'a + 1'`) and 4x (for relatively complex ones like :code:`'a*b-4.1*a > 2.5*b'`),\\nalthough much higher speed-ups can be achieved for some functions  and complex\\nmath operations (up to 15x in some cases).\\n\\nNumExpr performs best on matrices that are too large to fit in L1 CPU cache.\\nIn order to get a better idea on the different speed-ups that can be achieved\\non your platform, run the provided benchmarks.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nFrom wheels\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNumExpr is available for install via `pip` for a wide range of platforms and\\nPython versions (which may be browsed at: https://pypi.org/project/numexpr/#files).\\nInstallation can be performed as::\\n\\n    pip install numexpr\\n\\nIf you are using the Anaconda or Miniconda distribution of Python you may prefer\\nto use the `conda` package manager in this case::\\n\\n    conda install numexpr\\n\\nFrom Source\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOn most \\\\*nix systems your compilers will already be present. However if you\\nare using a virtual environment with a substantially newer version of Python than\\nyour system Python you may be prompted to install a new version of `gcc` or `clang`.\\n\\nFor Windows, you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\\n(which are free) first. The version depends on which version of Python you have\\ninstalled:\\n\\nhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers\\n\\nFor Python 3.6+ simply installing the latest version of MSVC build tools should\\nbe sufficient. Note that wheels found via pip do not include MKL support. Wheels\\navailable via `conda` will have MKL, if the MKL backend is used for NumPy.\\n\\nSee `requirements.txt` for the required version of NumPy.\\n\\nNumExpr is built in the standard Python way::\\n\\n  python setup.py build install\\n\\nYou can test `numexpr` with::\\n\\n  python -c \\\"import numexpr; numexpr.test()\\\"\\n\\nDo not test NumExpr in the source directory or you will generate import errors.\\n\\nEnable Intel® MKL support\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNumExpr includes support for Intel's MKL library. This may provide better\\nperformance on Intel architectures, mainly when evaluating transcendental\\nfunctions (trigonometrical, exponential, ...).\\n\\nIf you have Intel's MKL, copy the `site.cfg.example` that comes with the\\ndistribution to `site.cfg` and edit the latter file to provide correct paths to\\nthe MKL libraries in your system.  After doing this, you can proceed with the\\nusual building instructions listed above.\\n\\nPay attention to the messages during the building process in order to know\\nwhether MKL has been detected or not.  Finally, you can check the speed-ups on\\nyour machine by running the `bench/vml_timing.py` script (you can play with\\ndifferent parameters to the `set_vml_accuracy_mode()` and `set_vml_num_threads()`\\nfunctions in the script so as to see how it would affect performance).\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\n::\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> import numexpr as ne\\n\\n  >>> a = np.arange(1e6)   # Choose large arrays for better speedups\\n  >>> b = np.arange(1e6)\\n\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"a + 1\\\")   # a simple expression\\n  array([  1.00000000e+00,   2.00000000e+00,   3.00000000e+00, ...,\\n           9.99998000e+05,   9.99999000e+05,   1.00000000e+06])\\n\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"a * b - 4.1 * a > 2.5 * b\\\")   # a more complex one\\n  array([False, False, False, ...,  True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)\\n\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"sin(a) + arcsinh(a/b)\\\")   # you can also use functions\\n  array([        NaN,  1.72284457,  1.79067101, ...,  1.09567006,\\n          0.17523598, -0.09597844])\\n\\n  >>> s = np.array([b'abba', b'abbb', b'abbcdef'])\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"b'abba' == s\\\")   # string arrays are supported too\\n  array([ True, False, False], dtype=bool)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nPlease see the official documentation at `numexpr.readthedocs.io <https://numexpr.readthedocs.io>`_.\\nIncluded is a user guide, benchmark results, and the reference API.\\n\\n\\nAuthors\\n-------\\n\\nPlease see `AUTHORS.txt <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt>`_.\\n\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\nNumExpr is distributed under the `MIT <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_ license.\\n\\n\\n..

It aims to provide selecting,\\nmatching, and filtering using modern CSS selectors. Soup Sieve currently provides selectors from the CSS level 1\\nspecifications up through the latest CSS level 4 drafts and beyond (though some are not yet implemented).\\n\\nSoup Sieve was written with the intent to replace Beautiful Soup's builtin select feature, and as of Beautiful Soup\\nversion 4.7.0, it now is :confetti_ball:. Soup Sieve can also be imported in order to use its API directly for\\nmore controlled, specialized parsing.\\n\\nSoup Sieve has implemented most of the CSS selectors up through the latest CSS draft specifications, though there are a\\nnumber that don't make sense in a non-browser environment. Selectors that cannot provide meaningful functionality simply\\ndo not match anything. Some of the supported selectors are:\\n\\n- `.classes`\\n- `#ids`\\n- `[attributes=value]`\\n- `parent child`\\n- `parent > child`\\n- `sibling ~ sibling`\\n- `sibling + sibling`\\n- `:not(element.class, element2.class)`\\n- `:is(element.class, element2.class)`\\n- `parent:has(> child)`\\n- and [many more](https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/selectors/)\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou must have Beautiful Soup already installed:\\n\\n```\\npip install beautifulsoup4\\n```\\n\\nIn most cases, assuming you've installed version 4.7.0, that should be all you need to do, but if you've installed via\\nsome alternative method, and Soup Sieve is not automatically installed, you can install it directly:\\n\\n```\\npip install soupsieve\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to manually install it from source, first ensure that [`build`](https://pypi.org/project/build/) is\\ninstalled:\\n\\n```\\npip install build\\n```\\n\\nThen navigate to the root of the project and build the wheel and install (replacing `<ver>` with the current version):\\n\\n```\\npython -m build -w\\npip install dist/soupsieve-<ver>-py3-none-any.whl\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nDocumentation is found here: https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT\\n\\n[bs4]: https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#\\n\\n[github-ci-image]: https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/workflows/build/badge.svg\\n[github-ci-link]: https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amain\\n[codecov-image]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/facelessuser/soupsieve/master.svg?logo=codecov&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[codecov-link]: https://codecov.io/github/facelessuser/soupsieve\\n[pypi-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/soupsieve.svg?logo=pypi&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[pypi-down]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/soupsieve.svg?logo=pypi&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[pypi-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soupsieve\\n[python-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/soupsieve?logo=python&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[license-image-mit]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?labelColor=333333\\n[license-link]: https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/blob/main/LICENSE.md\\n[donate-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-3fabd1?logo=paypal\\n[donate-link]: https://www.paypal.me/facelessuser\\n\",\n",

It is written in C++11 and wrapped using pybind11.\\n\\nIt contains the 2005 and 2014 algorithms used in Matplotlib as well as a newer algorithm that includes more features and is available in both serial and multithreaded versions.  It provides an easy way for Python libraries to use contouring algorithms without having to include Matplotlib as a dependency.\\n\\n  * **Documentation**: https://contourpy.readthedocs.io\\n  * **Source code**: https://github.com/contourpy/contourpy\\n\\n| | |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Latest release | [![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/contourpy.svg?label=pypi&color=fdae61)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/contourpy) [![conda-forge version](https://img.shields.io/conda/v/conda-forge/contourpy.svg?label=conda-forge&color=a6d96a)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/contourpy) |\\n| Downloads | [![PyPi downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/contourpy?label=pypi&style=flat&color=fdae61)](https://pepy.tech/project/contourpy) |\\n| Python version | [![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/contourpy?color=fdae61)](https://pypi.org/project/contourpy/) |\\n| Coverage | [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/contourpy/contourpy?color=fdae61&label=codecov)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/contourpy/contourpy) |\\n\",\n",

It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality and providing an intelligent module API that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.\\n\\nArrow is named after the `arrow of time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time>`_ and is heavily inspired by `moment.js <https://github.com/moment/moment>`_ and `requests <https://github.com/psf/requests>`_.\\n\\nWhy use Arrow over built-in modules?\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nPython's standard library and some other low-level modules have near-complete date, time and timezone functionality, but don't work very well from a usability perspective:\\n\\n- Too many modules: datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz and more\\n- Too many types: date, time, datetime, tzinfo, timedelta, relativedelta, etc.\\n- Timezones and timestamp conversions are verbose and unpleasant\\n- Timezone naivety is the norm\\n- Gaps in functionality: ISO 8601 parsing, timespans, humanization\\n\\nFeatures\\n--------\\n\\n- Fully-implemented, drop-in replacement for datetime\\n- Support for Python 3.6+\\n- Timezone-aware and UTC by default\\n- Super-simple creation options for many common input scenarios\\n- ``shift`` method with support for relative offsets, including weeks\\n- Format and parse strings automatically\\n- Wide support for the `ISO 8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ standard\\n- Timezone conversion\\n- Support for ``dateutil``, ``pytz``, and ``ZoneInfo`` tzinfo objects\\n- Generates time spans, ranges, floors and ceilings for time frames ranging from microsecond to year\\n- Humanize dates and times with a growing list of contributed locales\\n- Extensible for your own Arrow-derived types\\n- Full support for PEP 484-style type hints\\n\\nQuick Start\\n-----------\\n\\nInstallation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo install Arrow, use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`_ or `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org>`_:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    $ pip install -U arrow\\n\\nExample Usage\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import arrow\\n    >>> arrow.get('2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00')\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00]>\\n\\n    >>> utc = arrow.utcnow()\\n    >>> utc\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+00:00]>\\n\\n    >>> utc = utc.shift(hours=-1)\\n    >>> utc\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T20:23:58.970460+00:00]>\\n\\n    >>> local = utc.to('US/Pacific')\\n    >>> local\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T13:23:58.970460-07:00]>\\n\\n    >>> local.timestamp()\\n    1368303838.970460\\n\\n    >>> local.format()\\n    '2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'\\n\\n    >>> local.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ')\\n    '2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'\\n\\n    >>> local.humanize()\\n    'an hour ago'\\n\\n    >>> local.humanize(locale='ko-kr')\\n    '한시간 전'\\n\\n.. end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nFor full documentation, please visit `arrow.readthedocs.io <https://arrow.readthedocs.io>`_.\\n\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nContributions are welcome for both code and localizations (adding and updating locales).

This file is included into docs/history.rst\\n\\n\\nGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent\\nprogramming.\\n\\nThe \\\"greenlet\\\" package is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version of\\nCPython that supports micro-threads called \\\"tasklets\\\". Tasklets run\\npseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)\\nand are synchronized with data exchanges on \\\"channels\\\".\\n\\nA \\\"greenlet\\\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of\\nmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.\\nThis is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.\\nYou can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;\\nhowever, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to\\nmake advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreate\\ngenerators; the difference with Python's own generators is that our\\ngenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions can\\nyield values too. (Additionally, you don't need a \\\"yield\\\" keyword. See\\nthe example in `test_generator.py\\n<https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/blob/adca19bf1f287b3395896a8f41f3f4fd1797fdc7/src/greenlet/tests/test_generator.py#L1>`_).\\n\\nGreenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified\\ninterpreter.\\n\\n.. _`Stackless`: http://www.stackless.com\\n\\n\\nWho is using Greenlet?\\n======================\\n\\nThere are several libraries that use Greenlet as a more flexible\\nalternative to Python's built in coroutine support:\\n\\n - `Concurrence`_\\n - `Eventlet`_\\n - `Gevent`_\\n\\n.. _Concurrence: http://opensource.hyves.org/concurrence/\\n.. _Eventlet: http://eventlet.net/\\n.. _Gevent: http://www.gevent.org/\\n\\nGetting Greenlet\\n================\\n\\nThe easiest way to get Greenlet is to install it with pip::\\n\\n  pip install greenlet\\n\\n\\nSource code archives and binary distributions are available on the\\npython package index at https://pypi.org/project/greenlet\\n\\nThe source code repository is hosted on github:\\nhttps://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet\\n\\nDocumentation is available on readthedocs.org:\\nhttps://greenlet.readthedocs.io\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"# uri-template\\n\\nAn implementation of RFC 6570 URI Templates.\\n\\nThis packages implements URI Template expansion in strict adherence to RFC 6570,\\nbut adds a few extensions.\\n\\n## RFC 6570 Extensions\\n\\n### Non-string Values\\n\\nRFC 6570 is silent regarding variable values that are not strings, lists, associative arrays, or null.\\n\\nThis package handles value types as follows:\\n\\n  * Values that are instances of `str` are treated as strings.\\n  * Values implementing `collections.abc.Sequence` are treated as lists.\\n  * Values implementing `collections.abc.Mapping` are treated as associative arrays.\\n  * `None` values are treated as null.\\n  * Boolean values are converted to the lower case strings 'true' and 'false'.\\n  * All other values will be converted to strings using the Python `str()` function.\\n\\n### Nested Structures\\n\\nThis package handles variable values with nested structure,\\nfor example, lists containing other lists or associative arrays,\\nor associative arrays containing lists or other associative arrays.\\n\\nNested values for variables that do not use the array modifier ('[]') are treated as follows:\\n\\n  * Lists containing lists are flattened into a single list.\\n  * Lists containing associative arrays are treated as a single combined associative array.\\n  * Associative arrays represent nested data using dot notation (\\\".\\\") for the variable names.\\n\\nNested values for variables that use the array modifier extend the variable name with \\nthe value's index or key written as an array subscript, e.g. \\\"foo[0]\\\" or \\\"foo[bar]\\\".\\n\\n### Default Values\\n\\nThis package allows default string values for variables per early drafts of RFC 6570.\\ne.g. \\\"{foo=bar}\\\" will expand to \\\"bar\\\" if a value for `foo` is not given.\\n\\nList and associtative array default values are not supported at this time.\\n\\n### Specifying Value Keys\\n\\nSometimes a URI Template is used to provide glue between an API and a given set of data.\\nIn this case, the names of values needed in the final URL may not match the data provided \\nfor the expansion.\\n\\nThis package allows specifying the key used to pass data into the template. \\ne.g. \\\"{?foo/bar}\\\" will expand to \\\"?foo=<the value provided as bar>\\\"\\n\\n### Partial expansion\\n\\nThis package allows partial expansion of URI Templates.\\n\\nIn a partial expansion, missing values preseve their expansion in the resultant output.\\ne.g. a partial expansion of \\\"{one}/{two}\\\" with a value for `one` of \\\"foo\\\" and `two` missing will result in:\\n\\\"foo/{two}\\\".\\n\\nIn order to allow partial expansions to preserve value joiners with expanded output,\\nexpansions accept an optional \\\"trailing joiner\\\" of \\\",\\\", \\\".\\\", \\\"/\\\", \\\";\\\", or \\\"&\\\",\\nif this joiner is present after all variables, \\nit will be appended to the output of the expansion and will suppress the output prefix.\\ne.g.: \\\"{#one,two}\\\" with a missing value for `one` and a value of \\\"bar\\\" for `two`, \\nwill partially expand to: \\\"#{#one,}bar\\\", which when provided with a value of \\\"foo\\\" for `one` \\nwill expand to \\\"#foo,bar\\\"\\n\\nSome partial expansions that have some output, but have missing values, \\nwill convert the remaining variables to a different type of expansion so that \\nfurther expansions will produce the same output as if all values were originally present.\\n\\n   * Partial Simple String Expansions will convert to Comma Expansions.\\n   * Partial Reserved Expansions Partial Fragment Expansions will convert to Reserved Comma Expansions.\\n   * Partial Form-Style Query Expansions will convert to Form-Style Query Continuations.\\n\\nIn order to preserve the resultant value of templates that are paritally expanded, \\nthe following additional Expression Expansions are supported:\\n\\n#### Comma Expansion: {,var}\\n\\nSimilar to Label Expansion with Dot-Prefix, \\nComma Expansion prefixes the expansion output with a single comma \\\",\\\".\\n\\n#### Reserved Comma Expansion: {,+var}\\n\\nSimilar to Comma Expansion, \\nReserved Comma Expansion prefixes the expansion output with a single comma \\\",\\\",\\nbut otherwise performs a Reserved Expansion ({+var}).\\n\\n## API \\n\\nThe package provides three functions:\\n\\n#### uri_template.expand(template: str, **kwargs) -> (str | None): ...\\n\\nExpand the given template, skipping missing values per RFC 6570.\\n\\nReturns `None` if the template is invalid or expansion fails.\\n\\n\\n#### uri_template.partial(template: str, **kwargs) -> (str | None): ...\\n\\nPartially expand the given template, \\nreplacing missing variables with further expansions.\\n\\nReturns `None` if the template is invalid or expansion fails.\\n\\n\\n#### uri_template.validate(template: str) -> bool: ...\\n\\nReturn `True` if the template is valid.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd the following classes:\\n\\n### uri_template.URITemplate\\n\\n#### URITemplate(template: str)\\n\\nConstruct a URITemplate for a given template string.\\n\\nRaises `ExpansionInvalid`, `ExpansionReserved`, or `VariableInvalid` if the template is invalid or unsupported.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.variables: Iterable[Variable]\\n\\nAll variables present in the template.\\nDuplicates are returned once, order is preserved.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.variable_names: Iterable[str]\\n\\nThe names of all variables present in the template.\\nDuplicates are returned once, order is preserved.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.expanded: bool\\n\\nDetermine if template is fully expanded.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.expand(**kwargs) -> str\\n\\nReturns the result of the expansion, skips missing variables.\\n\\nRaises `ExpansionFailed` if the expansion fails due to a composite value being passed to a variable with a prefix modifier.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.partial(**kwargs) -> URITemplate\\n\\nExpand the template, replacing missing variables with further expansions.\\n\\nRaises `ExpansionFailed` if the expansion fails due to a composite value being passed to a variable with a prefix modifier.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.__str__() -> str\\n\\nConvert the URITemplate object back into its original string form.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### uri_template.Variable\\n\\n#### Variable(var_spec: str)\\n\\nConstruct a Variable.\\n\\n#### Variable.name: str\\n\\nThe name of the variable\\n\\n#### Variable.max_length: int\\n\\nThe speicified max length, or `0`.\\n\\n#### Variable.explode: bool\\n\\nExplode modifier is present.\\n\\n#### Variable.array: bool\\n\\nArray modifier is present.\\n\\n#### Variable.default: (str | None)\\n\\nSpecified default value, or `None`.\\n\\n#### Variable.__str__() -> str\\n\\nConvert the variable back to its original string form.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd the following exceptions:\\n\\n#### uri_template.ExpansionInvalid\\n\\nExpansion specification is invalid. \\n\\nRaised by URITemplate constructor.\\n\\n#### uri_template.ExpansionReserved\\n\\nExpansion contains a reserved operator.\\n\\nRaised by URITemplate constructor.\\n\\n#### uri_template.VariableInvalid\\n\\nVariable specification is invalid.\\n\\nRaised by URITemplate constructor.\\n\\n#### uri_template.ExpansionFailed\\n\\nExpansion failed, currently only possible when a composite value is passed to a variable with a prefix modifier.\\n\\nRaised by URITemplate.expand() or URITemplate.partial() methods.\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nInstall with pip:\\n\\n    pip install uri-template\\n\",\n",

(Tested on Linux.) You can install this with `cargo install flamegraph`.\\n\\nRun `make build-profiling` to install a release build with debugging symbols included (needed for profiling).\\n\\nOnce that is built, you can profile pytest benchmarks with (e.g.):\\n\\n```bash\\nflamegraph -- pytest tests/benchmarks/test_micro_benchmarks.py -k test_list_of_ints_core_py --benchmark-enable\\n```\\nThe `flamegraph` command will produce an interactive SVG at `flamegraph.svg`.\\n\\n## Releasing\\n\\n1. Bump package version locally. Do not just edit `Cargo.toml` on Github, you need both `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to be updated.\\n2. Make a PR for the version bump and merge it.\\n3. Go to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/releases and click \\\"Draft a new release\\\"\\n4. In the \\\"Choose a tag\\\" dropdown enter the new tag `v<the.new.version>` and select \\\"Create new tag on publish\\\" when the option appears.\\n5. Enter the release title in the form \\\"v<the.new.version> <YYYY-MM-DD>\\\"\\n6. Click Generate release notes button\\n7. Click Publish release\\n8. Go to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/actions and ensure that all build for release are done successfully.\\n9. Go to https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-core/ and ensure that the latest release is published.\\n10. Done 🎉\\n\\n\",\n",

[TOML](https://toml.io).\\nIt is fully compatible with [TOML v1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).\\n\\nA version of Tomli, the `tomllib` module,\\nwas added to the standard library in Python 3.11\\nvia [PEP 680](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0680/).\\nTomli continues to provide a backport on PyPI for Python versions\\nwhere the standard library module is not available\\nand that have not yet reached their end-of-life.\\n\\nTomli uses [mypyc](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc)\\nto generate binary wheels for most of the widely used platforms,\\nso Python 3.11+ users may prefer it over `tomllib` for improved performance.\\nPure Python wheels are available on any platform and should perform the same as `tomllib`.\\n\\n## Installation<a name=\\\"installation\\\"></a>\\n\\n```bash\\npip install tomli\\n```\\n\\n## Usage<a name=\\\"usage\\\"></a>\\n\\n### Parse a TOML string<a name=\\\"parse-a-toml-string\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nimport tomli\\n\\ntoml_str = \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n[[players]]\\nname = \\\"Lehtinen\\\"\\nnumber = 26\\n\\n[[players]]\\nname = \\\"Numminen\\\"\\nnumber = 27\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ntoml_dict = tomli.loads(toml_str)\\nassert toml_dict == {\\n    \\\"players\\\": [{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Lehtinen\\\", \\\"number\\\": 26}, {\\\"name\\\": \\\"Numminen\\\", \\\"number\\\": 27}]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Parse a TOML file<a name=\\\"parse-a-toml-file\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nimport tomli\\n\\nwith open(\\\"path_to_file/conf.toml\\\", \\\"rb\\\") as f:\\n    toml_dict = tomli.load(f)\\n```\\n\\nThe file must be opened in binary mode (with the `\\\"rb\\\"` flag).\\nBinary mode will enforce decoding the file as UTF-8 with universal newlines disabled,\\nboth of which are required to correctly parse TOML.\\n\\n### Handle invalid TOML<a name=\\\"handle-invalid-toml\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nimport tomli\\n\\ntry:\\n    toml_dict = tomli.loads(\\\"]] this is invalid TOML [[\\\")\\nexcept tomli.TOMLDecodeError:\\n    print(\\\"Yep, definitely not valid.\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that error messages are considered informational only.\\nThey should not be assumed to stay constant across Tomli versions.\\n\\n### Construct `decimal.Decimal`s from TOML floats<a name=\\\"construct-decimaldecimals-from-toml-floats\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nfrom decimal import Decimal\\nimport tomli\\n\\ntoml_dict = tomli.loads(\\\"precision-matters = 0.982492\\\", parse_float=Decimal)\\nassert isinstance(toml_dict[\\\"precision-matters\\\"], Decimal)\\nassert toml_dict[\\\"precision-matters\\\"] == Decimal(\\\"0.982492\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that `decimal.Decimal` can be replaced with another callable that converts a TOML float from string to a Python type.\\nThe `decimal.Decimal` is, however, a practical choice for use cases where float inaccuracies can not be tolerated.\\n\\nIllegal types are `dict` and `list`, and their subtypes.\\nA `ValueError` will be raised if `parse_float` produces illegal types.\\n\\n### Building a `tomli`/`tomllib` compatibility layer<a name=\\\"building-a-tomlitomllib-compatibility-layer\\\"></a>\\n\\nPython versions 3.11+ ship with a version of Tomli:\\nthe `tomllib` standard library module.\\nTo build code that uses the standard library if available,\\nbut still works seamlessly with Python 3.6+,\\ndo the following.\\n\\nInstead of a hard Tomli dependency, use the following\\n[dependency specifier](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/)\\nto only require Tomli when the standard library module is not available:\\n\\n```\\ntomli >= 1.1.0 ; python_version < \\\"3.11\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen, in your code, import a TOML parser using the following fallback mechanism:\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys\\n\\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 11):\\n    import tomllib\\nelse:\\n    import tomli as tomllib\\n\\ntomllib.loads(\\\"['This parses fine with Python 3.6+']\\\")\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ<a name=\\\"faq\\\"></a>\\n\\n### Why this parser?<a name=\\\"why-this-parser\\\"></a>\\n\\n- it's lil'\\n- pure Python with zero dependencies\\n- the fastest pure Python parser [\\\\*](#pure-python):\\n  18x as fast as [tomlkit](https://pypi.org/project/tomlkit/),\\n  2.1x as fast as [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/)\\n- outputs [basic data types](#how-do-toml-types-map-into-python-types) only\\n- 100% spec compliant: passes all tests in\\n  [BurntSushi/toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test)\\n  test suite\\n- thoroughly tested: 100% branch coverage\\n\\n### Is comment preserving round-trip parsing supported?<a name=\\\"is-comment-preserving-round-trip-parsing-supported\\\"></a>\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThe `tomli.loads` function returns a plain `dict` that is populated with builtin types and types from the standard library only.\\nPreserving comments requires a custom type to be returned so will not be supported,\\nat least not by the `tomli.loads` and `tomli.load` functions.\\n\\nLook into [TOML Kit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit) if preservation of style is what you need.\\n\\n### Is there a `dumps`, `write` or `encode` function?<a name=\\\"is-there-a-dumps-write-or-encode-function\\\"></a>\\n\\n[Tomli-W](https://github.com/hukkin/tomli-w) is the write-only counterpart of Tomli, providing `dump` and `dumps` functions.\\n\\nThe core library does not include write capability, as most TOML use cases are read-only, and Tomli intends to be minimal.\\n\\n### How do TOML types map into Python types?<a

This is the latest version of\\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\\n\\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\\n\\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\\n\\nBasic functions are simply executed:\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna\\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\\n    ドメイン.テスト\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\\n\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\\nrespectively.\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna\\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\\n    ドメイン.テスト\\n\\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\\n``idna.codec`` module:\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna.codec\\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna2008'))\\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna2008'))\\n    домен.испытание\\n\\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\\n\\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\\n\\nThis library provides one such mapping that was developed by the\\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications. Strings are\\npreprocessed according to Section 4.4 “Preprocessing for IDNA2008”\\nprior to the IDNA operations.\\n\\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\\nconversion.\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna\\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\\n    ...\\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\\n    königsgäßchen\\n\\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\\n\\nImplementers should use transitional processing with caution, only in\\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\\nresults.\\n\\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\\nmodule name.\\n\\nExceptions\\n----------\\n\\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\\nclass.\\n\\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\\n\\nBuilding and Diagnostics\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\\n\\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\\nthree main modes:\\n\\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\\n\\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\\n\\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\\n\\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Notes\\n----------------\\n\\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\\n\\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.6 and higher.\\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\\n\\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\\n  Use \\\"idna<3\\\" in your requirements file if you need this library for\\n  a Python 2 application. Be advised that these versions are no longer\\n  actively developed.\\n\\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\\n\\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\\n\\n\",\n",

You need to make the fixing commit\\nyourself after that.\\n\\nSome of the hooks only run on CI by default, but you can invoke them by\\nrunning with the `--hook-stage manual` argument.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nAny class with trait attributes must inherit from `HasTraits`.\\nFor the list of available trait types and their properties, see the\\n[Trait Types](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trait_types.html)\\nsection of the documentation.\\n\\n### Dynamic default values\\n\\nTo calculate a default value dynamically, decorate a method of your class with\\n`@default({traitname})`. This method will be called on the instance, and\\nshould return the default value. In this example, the `_username_default`\\nmethod is decorated with `@default('username')`:\\n\\n```Python\\nimport getpass\\nfrom traitlets import HasTraits, Unicode, default\\n\\nclass Identity(HasTraits):\\n    username = Unicode()\\n\\n    @default('username')\\n    def _username_default(self):\\n        return getpass.getuser()\\n```\\n\\n### Callbacks when a trait attribute changes\\n\\nWhen a trait changes, an application can follow this trait change with\\nadditional actions.\\n\\nTo do something when a trait attribute is changed, decorate a method with\\n[`traitlets.observe()`](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html?highlight=observe#traitlets.observe).\\nThe method will be called with a single argument, a dictionary which contains\\nan owner, new value, old value, name of the changed trait, and the event type.\\n\\nIn this example, the `_num_changed` method is decorated with `` @observe(`num`) ``:\\n\\n```Python\\nfrom traitlets import HasTraits, Integer, observe\\n\\nclass TraitletsExample(HasTraits):\\n    num = Integer(5, help=\\\"a number\\\").tag(config=True)\\n\\n    @observe('num')\\n    def _num_changed(self, change):\\n        print(\\\"{name} changed from {old} to {new}\\\".format(**change))\\n```\\n\\nand is passed the following dictionary when called:\\n\\n```Python\\n{\\n  'owner': object,  # The HasTraits instance\\n  'new': 6,         # The new value\\n  'old': 5,         # The old value\\n  'name': \\\"foo\\\",    # The name of the changed trait\\n  'type': 'change', # The event type of the notification, usually 'change'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Validation and coercion\\n\\nEach trait type (`Int`, `Unicode`, `Dict` etc.) may have its own validation or\\ncoercion logic. In addition, we can register custom cross-validators\\nthat may depend on the state of other attributes. For example:\\n\\n```Python\\nfrom traitlets import HasTraits, TraitError, Int, Bool, validate\\n\\nclass Parity(HasTraits):\\n    value = Int()\\n    parity = Int()\\n\\n    @validate('value')\\n    def _valid_value(self, proposal):\\n        if proposal['value'] % 2 != self.parity:\\n            raise TraitError('value and parity should be consistent')\\n        return proposal['value']\\n\\n    @validate('parity')\\n    def _valid_parity(self, proposal):\\n        parity = proposal['value']\\n        if parity not in [0, 1]:\\n            raise TraitError('parity should be 0 or 1')\\n        if self.value % 2 != parity:\\n            raise TraitError('value and parity should be consistent')\\n        return proposal['value']\\n\\nparity_check = Parity(value=2)\\n\\n# Changing required parity and value together while holding cross validation\\nwith parity_check.hold_trait_notifications():\\n    parity_check.value = 1\\n    parity_check.parity = 1\\n```\\n\\nHowever, we **recommend** that custom cross-validators don't modify the state\\nof the HasTraits instance.\\n\\n## About the IPython Development Team\\n\\nThe IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython project.\\nThis includes all of the IPython subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nIPython uses a shared copyright model.

Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor and patch versions. Different minor versions likely include API-changes while patch versions do not change API.\\n\\nWhen a new minor version is released on PyPI, a branch for that version will be created in this repository, and the version of the main branch will be bumped to the next minor version number. That way, the main branch always reflects the latest un-released version.\\n\\nTo see the changes between releases, checkout the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\n## Usage - Running Jupyter Server\\n\\n### Running in a local installation\\n\\nLaunch with:\\n\\n```\\njupyter server\\n```\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#running-tests).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst).\\n\\n## Team Meetings and Roadmap\\n\\n- When: Thursdays [8:00am, Pacific time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=8%3A00%20am&tz=San%20Francisco&)\\n- Where: [Jovyan Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/95228013874?pwd=Ep7HIk8t9JP6VToxt1Wj4P7K5PshC0.1)\\n- What:\\n  - [Meeting notes](https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20Meeting%20Notes%20)\\n  - [Agenda](https://hackmd.io/Wmz_wjrLRHuUbgWphjwRWw)\\n\\nSee our tentative [roadmap here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/127).\\n\\n## About the Jupyter Development Team\\n\\nThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.\\nThis includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nJupyter uses a shared copyright model.

If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\\nchange to one of the Jupyter repositories.\\n\\nWith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\\n\\n```\\n# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.\\n# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.\\n```\\n\",\n",

This presents a practical problem:\\nWhen in an environment where the event loop is\\nalready running it's impossible to run tasks and wait\\nfor the result. Trying to do so will give the error\\n\\\"``RuntimeError: This event loop is already running``\\\".\\n\\nThe issue pops up in various environments, such as web servers,\\nGUI applications and in Jupyter notebooks.\\n\\nThis module patches asyncio to allow nested use of ``asyncio.run`` and\\n``loop.run_until_complete``.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n    pip3 install nest_asyncio\\n\\nPython 3.5 or higher is required.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    import nest_asyncio\\n    nest_asyncio.apply()\\n\\nOptionally the specific loop that needs patching can be given\\nas argument to ``apply``, otherwise the current event loop is used.\\nAn event loop can be patched whether it is already running\\nor not.

This is now supported in OpenMM 7.5.0 and later.\\n\\n**Espaloma:** Currently [`espaloma-0.3.2`](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma/releases/tag/0.3.2) is supported. See our [first espaloma paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01196) and our second paper which focuses on [protein-ligand systems and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07085).\\n\\n# Using the force fields\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package provides additional AMBER and CHARMM biopolymer force fields, small molecule support through GAFF and the [Open Force Field toolkit](http://openforcefield.org), and force field conversion tools.\\n\\nThe easiest way to install this package and its requisite dependencies is via [`conda`](https://conda.io):\\n```bash\\nconda install --yes -c conda-forge openmmforcefields\\n```\\n\\nIf you optionally have the [OpenEye Toolkits](https://www.eyesopen.com/toolkit-development) installed, `openmmforcefields` will use these to accelerate small molecule parameterization.\\nFree academic licenses are available for [bona fide academic research](https://www.eyesopen.com/academic-licensing), while licenses for IP generation are available [for a fee](https://www.eyesopen.com/pricing).\\n\\nSupport for the SMIRNOFF residue template or system generators requires OpenMM 7.4.2 or later.\\n\\n## Using the AMBER and CHARMM biopolymer force fields\\n\\nThis repository contains force fields for use with the [OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#force-fields) for parameterizing biomolecular systems.\\nIf you're not familiar with this approach to applying parameters to biomolecular systems, please see the [OpenMM User Guide](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#force-fields).\\n\\n### Using the AMBER force fields\\n\\nOnce installed, the AMBER force fields will be registered in the `amber/` relative path searched by [`openmm.app.ForceField`](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField).\\n\\nFor example, to specify the newer recommended [`ff14SB`](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255) force field and accompanying recommended ions and solvent models (corresponding to force fields loaded in LEaP with `leaprc.protein.ff14SB`), prepend the `amber` prefix and the `.xml` suffix:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\")\\n```\\nTo access just the [`ff14SB`](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255) force field converted from `oldff/leaprc.ff14SB`:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"amber/ff14SB.xml\\\")\\n```\\nor to specifically access the older (now outdated) `ff99SBildn` force field converted from `oldff/leaprc.ff14SB`:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"amber/ff99SBildn.xml\\\")\\n```\\nThe TIP3P conversion also includes the [Joung and Cheatham recommended salt models](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp8001614) (`parm/frcmod.ionsjc_tip3p`) and recommended divalent counterion parameters (`parm/frcmod.ions234lm_126_tip3p`):\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\n    \\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml\\\",\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Using the CHARMM force fields\\n\\nSimilarly, the CHARMM force fields will be registered in the `charmm/` relative path.\\nFor example, model system small molecule templates corresponding to amino acids can be accessed with:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"charmm/toppar_all36_prot_model.xml\\\")\\n```\\n\\n## Using AMBER GAFF 1.x and 2.x for small molecules\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package includes a [residue template generator](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#adding-residue-template-generators) for [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) that automatically generates OpenMM residue templates for small molecules lacking parameters using [GAFF](http://ambermd.org/antechamber/gaff.html) versions 1 or 2.\\n\\n### Cheminformatics toolkits\\n\\nThe [`openff-toolkit`](http://openforcefield.org) is used to provide an interface with cheminformatics toolkits to interact with [`antechamber`](http://ambermd.org/antechamber/) from the [AmberTools](http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) package to generate parameters for small molecules.\\nBy default, the [`openff-toolkit`](http://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit) will make use of the free and open source [RDKit cheminformatics toolkit](https://www.rdkit.org/) that is installed automatically, but will optionally use the [OpenEye toolkit](https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/index.html) if it is installed and licensed.\\nThe OpenEye toolkit is available [for free for academics for non-IP-generating academic research](https://www.eyesopen.com/academic-licensing).\\n\\n### On-the-fly template generation for small molecules\\n\\nGeneration of OpenMM-compatible parameters for small molecules encountered in an OpenMM `Topology` is handled through `openmmforcefields.generators.GAFFTemplateGenerator`.\\nBecause the [OpenMM `Topology` object](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.topology.Topology.html#openmm.app.topology.Topology) used by [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) does not know the precise chemical identity of molecules represented in the topology---which contain only elements and bonds between them, without stereochemical or bond order information---it is necessary to instruct `GAFFTemplateGenerator` which small molecules it will encounter in processing the `Topology` object ahead of time; it then matches these by element and bond pattern.\\n\\n### Specifying molecules\\n\\nTo do this, it is necessary to specify one or more [`openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule`](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) objects which can easily be created from many different representations of small molecules, including SMILES strings and common molecule storage formats.\\nThere are many ways to create an [OpenFF `Molecule` object](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) from various file formats as well---see the [API docs](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) for more details.\\n\\n### Partial charges for small molecules\\n\\nIf the provided molecule(s) contain nonzero (user-specified) partial charges (stored in the `Molecule.partial_charges` attribute), those partial charges will be used.\\nIf they do _not_ contain partial charges, the OpenFF Toolkit is used to generate them.\\n\\n* In `GAFFTemplateGenerator`, [Antechamber](http://ambermd.org/antechamber/) from the [AmberTools](http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) distribution (which uses the `sqm` semiempirical quantum chemical package) is used to assign AM1-BCC charges (`antechamber -c bcc`). The conformers used in charge assignment are generated by RDKit.\\n* In `SMIRNOFFTemplateGenerator`, the charges are assigned by the OpenFF software according to the [AM1-BCC settings of the SMIRNOFF specification](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/#toolkitam1bcc-temporary-support-for-toolkit-based-am1-bcc-partial-charges).\\n  * If OpenEye Toolkits are installed and licensed, OpenEye's Quacpac Toolkit is used to generate [AM1-BCC-ELF10 charges](https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/quacpactk/OEProtonClasses/OEAM1BCCELF10Charges.html). In this case, the conformers used to generate charges are generated by OpenEye's Omega Toolkit.\\n  * If OpenEye Toolkits are not installed or not licensed, AmberTools's Antechamber/`sqm` is used to generate AM1-BCC charges in the same way that it is used in `GAFFTemplateGenerator`. In this case, the conformers used to generate charges are generated by RDKit.\\n\\n*Note:* The `Molecule` object must have the all protons and stereochemistry explicitly specified, and must match the exact protonation and tautomeric state of the molecule that will be found in your OpenMM `Topology` object.\\nThe atom ordering need not be the same.\\n\\n*Note:* The first time a `Molecule` is specified, added, or cached, if it lacks partial charges, the automatically generated charges will be cached and reused; if it contains user-specified partial charges, those charges will be used and cached. Adding the molecule again with a different set of charges will have no effect on changing which charges are assigned.\\n\\n### Caching\\n\\n`GAFFTemplateGenerator` also supports the ability to specify a cache filename, allowing parameters for small molecules to be computed only once and then cached in the specified cache file thereafter.\\n\\n### Examples using `GAFFTemplateGenerator` to generate small molecule GAFF parameters\\n\\nCreate a GAFF template generator for a single molecule (benzene, created from SMILES) and register it with ForceField:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create an OpenFF Molecule object for benzene from SMILES\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\n\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_smiles(\\\"c1ccccc1\\\")\\n# Create the GAFF template generator\\nfrom openmmforcefields.generators import (\\n    GAFFTemplateGenerator,\\n)\\n\\ngaff = GAFFTemplateGenerator(molecules=molecule)\\n# Create an OpenMM ForceField object with AMBER ff14SB and TIP3P with compatible ions\\nfrom openmm.app import ForceField\\n\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\n    \\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml\\\",\\n)\\n# Register the GAFF template generator\\nforcefield.registerTemplateGenerator(gaff.generator)\\n# You can now parameterize an OpenMM Topology object that contains the specified molecule.\\n# forcefield will load the appropriate GAFF parameters when needed, and antechamber\\n# will be used to generate small molecule parameters on the fly.\\nfrom openmm.app import PDBFile\\n\\npdbfile = PDBFile(\\\"t4-lysozyme-L99A-with-benzene.pdb\\\")\\nsystem = forcefield.createSystem(pdbfile.topology)\\n```\\n\\nThe latest available GAFF version is used if none is specified.\\nYou can check which GAFF version is in use with\\n\\n```pycon\\n>>> gaff.gaff_version\\n'2.11'\\n````\\n\\nCreate a template generator for a specific GAFF version for multiple molecules read from an SDF file:\\n\\n```python\\nmolecules = Molecule.from_file(\\\"molecules.sdf\\\")\\ngaff = GAFFTemplateGenerator(molecules=molecules, forcefield=\\\"gaff-2.11\\\")\\n```\\nYou can also add molecules to the generator later, even after the generator has been registered:\\n```python\\ngaff.add_molecules(molecule)\\ngaff.add_molecules([molecule1, molecule2])\\n```\\nTo check which GAFF versions are supported, examine the `INSTALLED_FORCEFIELDS` attribute:\\n```pycon\\n>>> print(GAFFTemplateGenerator.INSTALLED_FORCEFIELDS)\\n['gaff-1.4', 'gaff-1.8', 'gaff-1.81', 'gaff-2.1', 'gaff-2.11']\\n```\\nYou can optionally specify a file that contains a cache of pre-parameterized molecules:\\n```python\\ngenerator = GAFFTemplateGenerator(cache=\\\"gaff-molecules.json\\\", forcefield=\\\"gaff-1.8\\\")\\n```\\nNewly parameterized molecules will be written to the cache, saving time next time these molecules are encountered.\\n\\n## Using the Open Force Field Initiative SMIRNOFF small molecule force fields\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package includes a [residue template generator](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#adding-residue-template-generators) for [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) that automatically generates OpenMM residue templates for small molecules lacking parameters using the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) [SMIRNOFF](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/)small molecule force fields.\\nThis includes the [`openff-1.x.y` (\\\"Parsley\\\")](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/) and [`openff-2.x.y` (\\\"Sage\\\")](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00039) small molecule force field lines, including the [most recent force field in each lines](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields).\\n\\nThe `SMIRNOFFTemplateGenerator` residue template generator operates in a manner very similar to `GAFFTemplateGenerator`, so we only

encountered.\\n\\n## Using espaloma to generate small molecule force fields\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package includes a [residue template generator](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#adding-residue-template-generators) for [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) that can automatically generate OpenMM residue templates for small molecules lacking parameters using [espaloma](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma) via one of its released force fields, provided `espaloma` and its dependencies are installed.\\n`espaloma` uses a [graph convolutional model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01196) to generate both valence parameters and fast partial charges.\\n\\n\\nThe `EspalomaTemplateGenerator` residue template generator operates in a manner very similar to `GAFFTemplateGenerator`, so we only highlight its differences here.\\n\\n**This feature is currently experimental and its API is subject to change.**\\n\\n### Examples using `EspalomaTemplateGenerator` to generate small molecule parameters with espaloma\\n\\nCreate an espaloma template generator for a single molecule (benzene, created from SMILES) and register it with ForceField:\\n```python\\n# Create an OpenFF Molecule object for benzene from SMILES\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\n\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_smiles(\\\"c1ccccc1\\\")\\n# Create the SMIRNOFF template generator with the released espaloma-0.3.2 force field\\nfrom openmmforcefields.generators import (\\n    EspalomaTemplateGenerator,\\n)\\n\\nespaloma = EspalomaTemplateGenerator(molecules=molecule, forcefield=\\\"espaloma-0.3.2\\\")\\n# Create an OpenMM ForceField object with AMBER ff14SB and TIP3P with compatible ions\\nfrom openmm.app import ForceField\\n\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\n    \\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml\\\",\\n)\\n# Register the SMIRNOFF template generator\\nforcefield.registerTemplateGenerator(espaloma.generator)\\n```\\nCreate a template generator for a specific espaloma force field for multiple molecules read from an SDF file:\\n```python\\nmolecules = Molecule.from_file(\\\"molecules.sdf\\\")\\n# Create an espaloma residue template generator from the espaloma-0.3.2 release,\\n# retrieving it automatically from GitHub release artifacts\\nespaloma = EspalomaTemplateGenerator(molecules=molecules, forcefield=\\\"espaloma-0.3.2\\\")\\n# Create an espaloma residue template generator from an espaloma model retrieved from a URL\\nespaloma = EspalomaTemplateGenerator(\\n    molecules=molecules,\\n    forcefield=\\\"https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma/releases/download/0.3.2/espaloma-0.3.2.pt\\\",\\n)\\n# Create an espaloma residue template generator from an espaloma model stored in a local file\\nespaloma = EspalomaTemplateGenerator(\\n    molecules=molecules,\\n    forcefield=\\\"/path/to/espaloma-0.3.2.pt\\\",\\n)\\n```\\nYou can also add molecules to the generator later, even after the generator has been registered:\\n```python\\nsmirnoff.add_molecules(molecule)\\nsmirnoff.add_molecules([molecule1, molecule2])\\n```\\nYou can optionally specify a file that contains a cache of pre-parameterized molecules:\\n```python\\nespaloma = EspalomaTemplateGenerator(\\n    cache=\\\"espaloma-molecules.json\\\",\\n    forcefield=\\\"espaloma-0.3.2\\\",\\n)\\n```\\nNewly parameterized molecules will be written to the cache, saving time next time these molecules are encountered.\\n\\n## Automating force field management with `SystemGenerator`\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package provides the `openmmforcefields.generators.SystemGenerator` class that handles management of common force fields transparently for you.\\n\\n### Using `SystemGenerator` to automate the use of AMBER force fields with GAFF, OpenFF, or espaloma for small molecule parameterization\\n\\nHere's an example that uses GAFF 2.11 along with the new `ff14SB` generation of AMBER force fields (and compatible solvent models) to generate an OpenMM `System` object from an [Open Force Field `Topology`](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Topology.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Topology) object:\\n```python\\n# Define the keyword arguments to feed to ForceField\\nfrom openmm import unit\\nfrom openmm import app\\n\\nforcefield_kwargs = {\\n    \\\"constraints\\\": app.HBonds,\\n    \\\"rigidWater\\\": True,\\n    \\\"removeCMMotion\\\": False,\\n    \\\"hydrogenMass\\\": 4 * unit.amu,\\n}\\n# Initialize a SystemGenerator using GAFF\\nfrom openmmforcefields.generators import SystemGenerator\\n\\nsystem_generator = SystemGenerator(\\n    forcefields=[\\n        \\\"amber/ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n        \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    ],\\n    small_molecule_forcefield=\\\"gaff-2.11\\\",\\n    forcefield_kwargs=forcefield_kwargs,\\n    cache=\\\"db.json\\\",\\n)\\n# Create an OpenMM System from an OpenMM Topology object\\nsystem = system_generator.create_system(openmm_topology)\\n# Alternatively, create an OpenMM System from an OpenMM Topology object and a list of OpenFF Molecule objects\\nmolecules = Molecule.from_file(\\\"molecules.sdf\\\", file_format=\\\"sdf\\\")\\nsystem = system_generator.create_system(openmm_topology, molecules=molecules)\\n```\\nParameterized molecules are cached in `db.json`.\\nParameters for multiple force fields can be held in the same cache file.\\n\\nBy default, `SystemGenerator` will use `PME` for periodic systems and `NoCutoff` for non-periodic systems.\\nYou can modify this behavior with the optional `periodic_forcefield_kwargs` and `nonperiodic_forcefield_kwargs` arguments, which are used to update `forcefield_kwargs` depending on whether the system is periodic or non-periodic:\\n```python\\nfrom openmm import app\\n\\nsystem_generator = SystemGenerator(\\n    forcefields=[\\n        \\\"amber/ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n        \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    ],\\n    periodic_forcefield_kwargs={\\\"nonbondedMethod\\\": app.LJPME},\\n    nonperiodic_forcefield_kwargs={\\\"nonbondedMethod\\\": app.CutoffNonPeriodic},\\n)\\n```\\n\\nTo use the [Open Force Field `openff-1.2.0`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields), an update of the [Open Force Field (\\\"Parsley\\\") small molecule force field](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/) instead of GAFF 2.11, we would have instead specified `small_molecule_forcefield='openff-1.2.0'`.\\n\\nTo use [espaloma](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma) for assigning small molecule parameters, for example with the [`espaloma-0.3.2` model](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma/releases/tag/0.3.2) released with the [espaloma preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07085), you can specify `small_molecule_forcefield='espaloma-0.3.2'`.\\n\\n# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n\\n**Q:** What is the minimum version of OpenMM required to use this package?\\n<br>\\n**A:** You need at least OpenMM 7.4.2 to use the `openmmforcefields` package.\\n\\n**Q:** Do you support the new [Amber ff19SB protein force field](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/ff19SB_Amino-Acid_Specific_Protein_Backbone_Parameters_Trained_Against_Quantum_Mechanics_Energy_Surfaces_in_Solution/8279681/1)?\\n<br>\\n**A:** [ParmEd](http://github.com/parmed/parmed), which is used to convert these force fields to OpenMM format, [does not currently support the conversion of AMBER CMAP forces to OpenMM](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd/issues/1066), so we do not yet support this force field, but hope to add support soon.\\n\\n**Q:** Do you plan to support other small molecule force fields?\\n<br>\\n**A:** If there are other free and open source conda-installable tools for generating parameters for other AMBER- or CHARMM-compatible force fields, we are happy to add support for them!\\n\\n# Converting AMBER and CHARMM to OpenMM ffxml files\\n\\nSee the corresponding directories for information on how to use the provided conversion tools:\\n\\n* `amber/` - AMBER force fields and conversion tools\\n* `charmm/` - CHARMM force fields and conversion tools\\n\\n# [Changelog](https://github.com/openmm/openmmforcefields/releases)\\n\\n## 0.14.1 Bring back GAFFTemplateGenerator for OpenMM >=7.6.0\\n\\nThis release brings back GAFF force feild support for all versions of OpenMM previously supported.\\nAdditionally, we now use the output of parmchk2 for all GAFF parameters.\\nPreviously we used gaff.dat + parmchk2 output to generate forcefield parameters.\\nFunctionally this doesn't change the end user experience but means we do not need to create new forcefield XML files for newer GAFF versions and now support whatever GAFF versions that parmchk2 supports for the installed AmberTools version.\\nThe XML files in `openmmforcefields/ffxml/amber/gaff/ffxml` may be removed in a future release.\\n\\n## 0.14.0 Bring back GAFFTemplateGenerator\\n\\nThis release effectively reverts the changes in 0.13.0.

Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the\\n`seminal Cassowary paper <https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf>`_.\\nIt is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi has been designed\\nfrom the ground up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500x\\nfaster than the original Cassowary solver with typical use cases gaining a 40x\\nimprovement. Memory savings are consistently > 5x.\\n\\nIn addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships with hand-rolled Python bindings for\\nPython 3.7+.\\n\",\n",

Consequently, you should use:\\n\\n- pandocfilters version <= 1.2.4 for pandoc versions 1.12--1.15, and\\n- pandocfilters version >= 1.3.0 for pandoc versions >= 1.16.\\n\\nPandoc 1.17.3 (pandoc-types 1.17.*) introduced a new JSON format.\\npandocfilters 1.4.0 should work with both the old and the new\\nformat.\\n\\nInstalling\\n--------------\\nRun this inside the present directory::\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\nOr install from PyPI::\\n\\n    pip install pandocfilters\\n\\nAvailable functions\\n----------------------\\nThe main functions ``pandocfilters`` exports are\\n\\n-  ``walk(x, action, format, meta)``\\n\\n   Walk a tree, applying an action to every object. Returns a modified\\n   tree. An action is a function of the form\\n   ``action(key, value, format, meta)``, where:\\n\\n   -  ``key`` is the type of the pandoc object (e.g. 'Str', 'Para')\\n   -  ``value`` is the contents of the object (e.g. a string for 'Str', a list of\\n      inline elements for 'Para')\\n   -  ``format`` is the target output format (as supplied by the\\n      ``format`` argument of ``walk``)\\n   -  ``meta`` is the document's metadata\\n\\n   The return of an action is either:\\n\\n   -  ``None``: this means that the object should remain unchanged\\n   -  a pandoc object: this will replace the original object\\n   -  a list of pandoc objects: these will replace the original object;\\n      the list is merged with the neighbors of the original objects\\n      (spliced into the list the original object belongs to); returning\\n      an empty list deletes the object\\n\\n-  ``toJSONFilter(action)``\\n\\n   Like ``toJSONFilters``, but takes a single action as argument.\\n\\n-  ``toJSONFilters(actions)``\\n\\n   Generate a JSON-to-JSON filter from stdin to stdout\\n\\n   The filter:\\n\\n   -  reads a JSON-formatted pandoc document from stdin\\n   -  transforms it by walking the tree and performing the actions\\n   -  returns a new JSON-formatted pandoc document to stdout\\n\\n   The argument ``actions`` is a list of functions of the form\\n   ``action(key, value, format, meta)``, as described in more detail\\n   under ``walk``.\\n\\n   This function calls ``applyJSONFilters``, with the ``format``\\n   argument provided by the first command-line argument, if present.\\n   (Pandoc sets this by default when calling filters.)\\n\\n-  ``applyJSONFilters(actions, source, format=\\\"\\\")``\\n\\n   Walk through JSON structure and apply filters\\n\\n   This:\\n\\n   -  reads a JSON-formatted pandoc document from a source string\\n   -  transforms it by walking the tree and performing the actions\\n   -  returns a new JSON-formatted pandoc document as a string\\n\\n   The ``actions`` argument is a list of functions (see ``walk`` for a\\n   full description).\\n\\n   The argument ``source`` is a string encoded JSON object.\\n\\n   The argument ``format`` is a string describing the output format.\\n\\n   Returns a new JSON-formatted pandoc document.\\n\\n-  ``stringify(x)``\\n\\n   Walks the tree x and returns concatenated string content, leaving out\\n   all formatting.\\n\\n-  ``attributes(attrs)``\\n\\n   Returns an attribute list, constructed from the dictionary attrs.\\n\\nHow to use\\n----------\\nMost users will only need ``toJSONFilter``.  Here is a simple example\\nof its use::\\n\\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Pandoc filter to convert all regular text to uppercase.\\n    Code, link URLs, etc. are not affected.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    from pandocfilters import toJSONFilter, Str\\n\\n    def caps(key, value, format, meta):\\n      if key == 'Str':\\n        return Str(value.upper())\\n\\n    if __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n      toJSONFilter(caps)\\n\\nExamples\\n--------\\n\\nThe examples subdirectory in the source repository contains the\\nfollowing filters. These filters should provide a useful starting point\\nfor developing your own pandocfilters.\\n\\n``abc.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``abc`` containing ABC\\n    notation into images. Assumes that abcm2ps and ImageMagick's convert\\n    are in the path. Images are put in the abc-images directory.\\n\\n``caps.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert all regular text to uppercase. Code, link\\n    URLs, etc. are not affected.\\n\\n``blockdiag.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class \\\"blockdiag\\\" into\\n    generated images. Needs utils from http://blockdiag.com.\\n\\n``comments.py``\\n    Pandoc filter that causes everything between\\n    ``<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->`` and ``<!-- END COMMENT -->`` to be ignored.\\n    The comment lines must appear on lines by themselves, with blank\\n    lines surrounding\\n\\n``deemph.py``\\n    Pandoc filter that causes emphasized text to be displayed in ALL\\n    CAPS.\\n\\n``deflists.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert definition lists to bullet lists with the\\n    defined terms in strong emphasis (for compatibility with standard\\n    markdown).\\n\\n``gabc.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert code blocks with class \\\"gabc\\\" to LaTeX\\n    \\\\\\\\gabcsnippet commands in LaTeX output, and to images in HTML output.\\n\\n``graphviz.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``graphviz`` into\\n    graphviz-generated images.\\n\\n``lilypond.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class \\\"ly\\\" containing\\n    Lilypond notation.\\n\\n``metavars.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to allow interpolation of metadata fields into a\\n    document. ``%{fields}`` will be replaced by the field's value, assuming\\n    it is of the type ``MetaInlines`` or ``MetaString``.\\n\\n``myemph.py``\\n    Pandoc filter that causes emphasis to be rendered using the custom\\n    macro ``\\\\myemph{...}`` rather than ``\\\\emph{...}`` in latex. Other output\\n    formats are unaffected.\\n\\n``plantuml.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``plantuml`` to images.\\n    Needs `plantuml.jar` from http://plantuml.com/.\\n\\n``ditaa.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``ditaa`` to images.\\n    Needs `ditaa.jar` from http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/.\\n\\n``theorem.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert divs with ``class=\\\"theorem\\\"`` to LaTeX theorem\\n    environments in LaTeX output, and to numbered theorems in HTML\\n    output.\\n\\n``tikz.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process raw latex tikz environments into images.\\n    Assumes that pdflatex is in the path, and that the standalone\\n    package is available. Also assumes that ImageMagick's convert is in\\n    the path. Images are put in the ``tikz-images`` directory.\\n\\nAPI documentation\\n-----------------\\n\\nBy default most filters use ``get_filename4code`` to\\ncreate a directory ``...-images`` to save temporary\\nfiles. This directory doesn't get removed as it can be used as a cache so that\\nlater pandoc runs don't have to recreate files if they already exist. The\\ndirectory is generated in the current directory.\\n\\nIf you prefer to have a clean directory after running pandoc filters, you\\ncan set an environment variable ``PANDOCFILTER_CLEANUP`` to any non-empty value such as `1`\\nwhich forces the code to create a temporary directory that will be removed\\nby the end of execution.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

A\\nlesser known aspect of the standard is the representation of durations. They have a\\nshape similar to this:\\n\\n```\\nP3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\\n```\\n\\nThis string represents a duration of 3 years, 6 months, 4 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes,\\nand 5 seconds.\\n\\nThe state of the art of ISO 8601 duration handling in Python is more or less limited to\\nwhat's offered by [`isodate`](https://pypi.org/project/isodate/). What we are trying to\\nachieve here is to address the shortcomings of `isodate` (as described in their own\\n[_Limitations_](https://github.com/gweis/isodate/#limitations) section), and a few of\\nour own annoyances with their interface, such as the lack of uniformity in their\\nhandling of types, and the use of regular expressions for parsing.\\n\\n## How to use it.\\n\\nThis package revolves around the [`Duration`](src/isoduration/types.py) type.\\n\\nGiven a ISO duration string we can produce such a type by using the `parse_duration()`\\nfunction:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> from isoduration import parse_duration\\n>>> duration = parse_duration(\\\"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\\\")\\n>>> duration.date\\nDateDuration(years=Decimal('3'), months=Decimal('6'), days=Decimal('4'), weeks=Decimal('0'))\\n>>> duration.time\\nTimeDuration(hours=Decimal('12'), minutes=Decimal('30'), seconds=Decimal('5'))\\n```\\n\\nThe `date` and `time` portions of the parsed duration are just regular\\n[dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), so their members can\\nbe accessed in a non-surprising way.\\n\\nBesides just parsing them, a number of additional operations are available:\\n\\n- Durations can be compared and negated:\\n  ```py\\n  >>> parse_duration(\\\"P3Y4D\\\") == parse_duration(\\\"P3Y4DT0H\\\")\\n  True\\n  >>> -parse_duration(\\\"P3Y4D\\\")\\n  Duration(DateDuration(years=Decimal('-3'), months=Decimal('0'), days=Decimal('-4'), weeks=Decimal('0')), TimeDuration(hours=Decimal('0'), minutes=Decimal('0'), seconds=Decimal('0')))\\n  ```\\n- Durations can be added to, or subtracted from, Python datetimes:\\n  ```py\\n  >>> from datetime import datetime\\n  >>> datetime(2020, 3, 15) + parse_duration(\\\"P2Y\\\")\\n  datetime.datetime(2022, 3, 15, 0, 0)\\n  >>> datetime(2020, 3, 15) - parse_duration(\\\"P33Y1M4D\\\")\\n  datetime.datetime(1987, 2, 11, 0, 0)\\n  ```\\n- Durations are hashable, so they can be used as dictionary keys or as part of sets.\\n- Durations can be formatted back to a ISO 8601-compliant duration string:\\n  ```py\\n  >>> from isoduration import parse_duration, format_duration\\n  >>> format_duration(parse_duration(\\\"P11YT2H\\\"))\\n  'P11YT2H'\\n  >>> str(parse_duration(\\\"P11YT2H\\\"))\\n  'P11YT2H'\\n  ```\\n\\n## How to improve it.\\n\\nThese steps, in this order, should land you in a development environment:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone git@github.com:bolsote/isoduration.git\\ncd isoduration/\\npython -m venv ve\\n. ve/bin/activate\\npip install -U pip\\npip install -e .\\npip install -r requirements/dev.txt\\n```\\n\\nAdapt to your own likings and/or needs.\\n\\nTesting is driven by [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io). The output of `tox -l` and a\\ncareful read of [tox.ini](tox.ini) should get you there.\\n\\n## FAQs.\\n\\n### How come `P1Y != P365D`?\\nSome years have 366 days. If it's not always the same, then it's not the same.\\n\\n### Why do you create your own types, instead of somewhat shoehorning a `timedelta`?\\n`timedelta` cannot represent certain durations, such as those involving years or months.\\nSince it cannot represent all possible durations without dangerous arithmetic, then it\\nmust not be the right type.\\n\\n### Why don't you use regular expressions to parse duration strings?\\n[Regular expressions should only be used to parse regular languages.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454)\\n\\n### Why is parsing the inverse of formatting, but the converse is not true?\\nBecause this wonderful representation is not unique.\\n\\n### Why do you support `<insert here a weird case>`?\\nProbably because the standard made me to.\\n\\n### Why do you not support `<insert here a weird case>`?\\nProbably because the standard doesn't allow me to.\\n\\n### Why is it not possible to subtract a datetime from a duration?\\nI'm confused.\\n\\n### Why should I use this over some other thing?\\nYou shouldn't do what people on the Internet tell you to do.\\n\\n### Why are ISO standards so strange?\\nYes.\\n\\n## References.\\n\\n- [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes, Appendix D](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats):\\n  This excitingly named document contains more details about ISO 8601 than any human\\n  should be allowed to understand.\\n- [`isodate`](https://pypi.org/project/isodate/): The original implementation of ISO\\n  durations in Python. Worth a look. But ours is cooler.\\n\",\n",

This library allows\\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\\n\\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\\nstandard Python distutils.\\n\\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\\n\\n    pip install pytz\\n\\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\\nadministrative user::\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\n\\npytz for Enterprise\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\\n\\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.\\n\\n\\nExample & Usage\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nLocalized times and date arithmetic\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n>>> from pytz import timezone\\n>>> import pytz\\n>>> utc = pytz.utc\\n>>> utc.zone\\n'UTC'\\n>>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')\\n>>> eastern.zone\\n'US/Eastern'\\n>>> amsterdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')\\n>>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z'\\n\\nThis library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The\\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\\ninformation):\\n\\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\\n\\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\\n\\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\\n\\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\\n\\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\\\ Does not work this way!\\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\\n\\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\\nas UTC:\\n\\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\\\ Not recommended except for UTC\\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\\n\\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\\nby humans.\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\\ntimezone.\\n\\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\\nsection for more details)\\n\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\\nstandard astimezone method.\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\\nTrue\\n\\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\\ndeal with.\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n\\n\\n``tzinfo`` API\\n--------------\\n\\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\\n\\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\\n\\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\\n\\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used\\nduring DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.\\n\\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=True))\\n-1 day, 21:30:00\\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))\\n1:00:00\\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)\\n'NDT'\\n\\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\\n-1 day, 21:30:00\\n>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\\n1:00:00\\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=True)\\n'NDT'\\n\\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))\\n-1 day, 21:30:00\\n>>> tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds\\n3600\\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)\\n'NDT'\\n\\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))\\n-1 day, 20:30:00\\n>>> tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\\ndatetime.timedelta(0)\\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\\n'NST'\\n\\nIf ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise\\nan ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError`` exception.\\n\\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))\\n-1 day, 21:30:00\\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal))\\n1:00:00\\n>>> tz.tzname(normal)\\n'NDT'\\n\\n>>> import pytz.exceptions\\n>>> try:\\n...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\\n>>> try:\\n...     tz.dst(ambiguous)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\\n>>> try:\\n...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\\n\\n\\nProblems with Localtime\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes\\nmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\\nhappens:\\n\\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\\n\\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\\n\\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\\n\\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\\n\\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\\n\\n>>> import pickle, pytz\\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\\n17\\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\\n>>> new == dt\\nTrue\\n>>> new is dt\\nFalse\\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\\nTrue\\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\\nTrue\\n\\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\\nnot compare the same in Python.\\n\\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\\nFalse\\n\\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\\n\\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\\n\\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\\n\\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\\ntimes.\\n\\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\\nTime:\\n\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\\n>>> try:\\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\\n\\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\\nthe entire hour:\\n\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\\n>>> try:\\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\\n\\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\\neasier:\\n\\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\\nTrue\\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\\n\\n\\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\\n'0:24:01'\\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\\n'0:00:01'\\n\\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\\n\\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\\nincluded for tests only!):\\n\\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\\n>>> str(dt)\\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\\n\\nNotice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are\\ncorrect, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are\\nactually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.\\n\\n>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests\\n>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))\\n'2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00'\\n>>> str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))\\n'2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00'\\n\\n\\nCountry Information\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nA mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use\\nfor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.\\nIt returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant\\ntzinfo instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:\\n\\n>>> print(' '.join(pytz.country_timezones['nz']))\\nPacific/Auckland Pacific/Chatham\\n\\nThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country\\nname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:\\n\\n>>> print(pytz.country_names['nz'])\\nNew Zealand\\n\\n\\nWhat is UTC\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n'UTC' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It is a successor to, but distinct\\nfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal\\nTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time\\nmeasurement.\\n\\nAll other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like\\nUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No\\ndaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform\\ndate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused\\nby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or\\nmobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.\\n\\n..  _Coordinated Universal Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\\n\\n\\nHelpers\\n~~~~~~~\\n\\nThere are two lists of timezones provided.\\n\\n``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can\\nbe used.\\n\\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones\\n>>> len(all_timezones) >= 500\\nTrue\\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in all_timezones\\nTrue\\n\\n``common_timezones`` is a list of useful, current timezones.

This\\n  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.\\n\\n- If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can't fix\\n  it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and\\n  changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.\\n  If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing\\n  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nMore info than you want to know about timezones:\\nhttps://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html\\n\\n\\nContact\\n~~~~~~~\\n\\nStuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\\n\",\n",

Example notebooks are rendered online among examples from other projects in the [OpenFF ecosysytem docs](https://docs.openforcefield.org/en/latest/examples.html)\\n\\n## How to cite\\n\\nPlease cite Interchange using the [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10068101) of the [latest release](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8147764) or the version that was used. The BibTeX reference of the latest release can be found [at this link](https://zenodo.org/record/8147764/export/hx).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nRecent versions of the OpenFF Toolkit (0.11.0+, released August 2022) install Interchange by default through its `conda` package.\\n\\nInterchange can also be installed manually via `conda` (or `mamba`):\\n\\n```shell\\nconda install openff-interchange -c conda-forge\\n```\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nThe `Iterchange` object serves primarily as a container object for parametrized data. It can currently take in [SMIRNOFF](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/) or [Foyer](https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/) force fields\\nand [chemical topologies](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/topology.html) prepared via the [OpenFF Toolkit](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/). The resulting object stores parametrized data and provides APIs for export to common formats.\\n\\n```python3\\nfrom openff.toolkit import ForceField, Molecule\\nfrom openff.units import unit\\n\\nfrom openff.interchange import Interchange\\n\\n\\n# Use the OpenFF Toolkit to generate a molecule object from a SMILES pattern\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_smiles(\\\"CCO\\\")\\n\\n# Generate a conformer to be used as atomic coordinates\\nmolecule.generate_conformers(n_conformers=1)\\n\\n# Convert this molecule to a topology\\ntopology = molecule.to_topology()\\n\\n# Define periodicity via box vectors\\ntopology.box_vectors = unit.Quantity([4, 4, 4], unit.nanometer)\\n\\n# Load OpenFF 2.0.0 \\\"Sage\\\"\\nsage = ForceField(\\\"openff-2.0.0.offxml\\\")\\n\\n# Create an Interchange object\\nout = Interchange.from_smirnoff(force_field=sage, topology=topology)\\n\\n# Convert the Interchnage object to an OpenMM System\\nsystem = out.to_openmm()\\n\\n# or write to GROMACS files\\nout.to_gro(\\\"out.gro\\\")\\nout.to_top(\\\"out.top\\\")\\n\\n# or store as JSON\\njson_blob = out.json()\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, please consult the [full documentation](https://openff-interchange.readthedocs.io/).\\n\\nFor more examples specific to Interchange, navigate to the `examples/` directory.\\n\\n**Please note that this software in an early and experimental state without a stable API or guarantees of long-term stability.**\\n\\n## Copyright\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2020, Open Force Field Initiative\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThe source code of Interchange is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-interchange) and is available under the MIT license (see the file LICENSE).

See the\\n  instructions in the `Building the docs`_ section for details.\\n\\nWorkflow to contribute\\n======================\\n\\nTo contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github\\n<https://github.com/>`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository\\n<https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_ to have your own repository,\\nclone it using ``git clone``. Make your changes in a branch of your clone, push\\nthem to your github account, test them locally, and when you are happy with\\nthem, send a pull request to the main repository.\\n\\nYou can use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/#install>`_ to run code style checks\\nbefore each commit::\\n\\n    pip install pre-commit\\n    pre-commit install\\n\\npre-commit checks can be disabled for a single commit with::\\n\\n    git commit -n\\n\\nRunning the test suite\\n======================\\n\\nTo run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.\\nRun the test suite using::\\n\\n    pytest joblib\\n\\nfrom the root of the project.\\n\\nBuilding the docs\\n=================\\n\\nTo build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4) and some dependencies\\ninstalled::\\n\\n    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txt\\n\\nThe docs can then be built with the following command::\\n\\n    make doc\\n\\nThe html docs are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.\\n\\n\\nMaking a source tarball\\n=======================\\n\\nTo create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the\\nfollowing command::\\n\\n    pip install build\\n    python -m build --sdist\\n\\nThe tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will create\\nthe resulting tarball that can be installed with no extra dependencies than the\\nPython standard library.\\n\\nMaking a release and uploading it to PyPI\\n=========================================\\n\\nThis command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and\\nupload in to PyPI::\\n\\n    pip install build\\n    python -m build --sdist --wheel\\n    twine upload dist/*\\n\\n\\nNote that the documentation should automatically get updated at each git\\npush. If that is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolve\\nany doc build error (in particular when running the examples).\\n\\nUpdating the changelog\\n======================\\n\\nChanges are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updated\\nbut, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::\\n\\n    git log --abbrev-commit --date=short --no-merges --sparse\\n\",\n",

See https://stackoverflow.com/q/1167617 for the\\ninitial inspiration for this library.\\n\\nMotivation\\n----------\\n\\nPython has no standard mechanism by which to guarantee that (1) a method that previously overrode an inherited method\\ncontinues to do so, and (2) a method that previously did not override an inherited will not override now.\\nThis opens the door for subtle problems as class hierarchies evolve over time. For example,\\n\\n1. A method that is added to a superclass is shadowed by an existing method with the same name in a \\n   subclass.\\n\\n2. A method of a superclass that is overridden by a subclass is renamed in the superclass but not in \\n   the subclass.\\n\\n3. A method of a superclass that is overridden by a subclass is removed in the superclass but not in\\n   the subclass.\\n\\n4. A method of a superclass that is overridden by a subclass but the signature of the overridden\\n   method is incompatible with that of the inherited one.\\n\\nThese can be only checked by explicitly marking method override in the code.\\n\\nPython also has no standard mechanism by which to inherit docstrings in overridden methods. Because \\nmost standard linters (e.g., flake8) have rules that require all public methods to have a docstring, \\nthis inevitably leads to a proliferation of ``See parent class for usage`` docstrings on overridden\\nmethods, or, worse, to a disabling of these rules altogether. In addition, mediocre or missing\\ndocstrings degrade the quality of tooltips and completions that can be provided by an editor.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nCompatible with Python 3.6+.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ pip install overrides\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nUse ``@override`` to indicate that a subclass method should override a superclass method.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from overrides import override\\n\\n    class SuperClass:\\n\\n        def foo(self):\\n            \\\"\\\"\\\"This docstring will be inherited by any method that overrides this!\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n            return 1\\n\\n        def bar(self, x) -> str:\\n            return x\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        @override\\n        def foo(self):\\n            return 2\\n\\n        @override\\n        def bar(self, y) -> int: # Raises, because the signature is not compatible.\\n            return y\\n            \\n        @override\\n        def zoo(self): # Raises, because does not exist in the super class.\\n            return \\\"foobarzoo\\\"\\n\\nUse ``EnforceOverrides`` to require subclass methods that shadow superclass methods to be decorated \\nwith ``@override``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n \\n    from overrides import EnforceOverrides\\n\\n    class SuperClass(EnforceOverrides):\\n\\n        def foo(self):\\n            return 1\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        def foo(self): # Raises, because @override is missing.\\n            return 2\\n\\nUse ``@final`` to indicate that a superclass method cannot be overriden.\\nWith Python 3.11 and above ``@final`` is directly `typing.final <https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/typing.html#typing.final>`_.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from overrides import EnforceOverrides, final, override\\n\\n    class SuperClass(EnforceOverrides):\\n\\n        @final\\n        def foo(self):\\n            return 1\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        @override\\n        def foo(self): # Raises, because overriding a final method is forbidden.\\n            return 2\\n\\nNote that ``@classmethod`` and ``@staticmethod`` must be declared before ``@override``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from overrides import override\\n\\n    class SuperClass:\\n\\n        @staticmethod\\n        def foo(x):\\n            return 1\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        @staticmethod\\n        @override\\n        def foo(x):\\n            return 2\\n\\n\\nFlags of control\\n----------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    # To prevent all signature checks do:\\n    @override(check_signature=False)\\n    def some_method(self, now_this_can_be_funny_and_wrong: str, what_ever: int) -> \\\"Dictirux\\\":\\n        pass\\n\\n    # To do the check only at runtime and solve some forward reference problems\\n    @override(check_at_runtime=True)\\n    def some_other_method(self, ..) -> \\\"SomethingDefinedLater\\\":\\n        pass\\n\\n    a.some_other_method() # Kaboom if not SomethingDefinedLater\\n\\n\\nContributors\\n------------\\n\\nThis project exists only through the work of all the people who contribute.\\n\\nmkorpela, drorasaf, ngoodman90, TylerYep, leeopop, donpatrice, jayvdb, joelgrus, lisyarus, \\nsoulmerge, rkr-at-dbx, ashwin153, brentyi,  jobh, tjsmart, bersbersbers, LysanderGG, mgorny.\\n\",\n",

Parso is also able\\nto list multiple syntax errors in your python file.\\n\\nParso has been battle-tested by jedi_. It was pulled out of jedi to be useful\\nfor other projects as well.\\n\\nParso consists of a small API to parse Python and analyse the syntax tree.\\n\\nA simple example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import parso\\n    >>> module = parso.parse('hello + 1', version=\\\"3.9\\\")\\n    >>> expr = module.children[0]\\n    >>> expr\\n    PythonNode(arith_expr, [<Name: hello@1,0>, <Operator: +>, <Number: 1>])\\n    >>> print(expr.get_code())\\n    hello + 1\\n    >>> name = expr.children[0]\\n    >>> name\\n    <Name: hello@1,0>\\n    >>> name.end_pos\\n    (1, 5)\\n    >>> expr.end_pos\\n    (1, 9)\\n\\nTo list multiple issues:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> grammar = parso.load_grammar()\\n    >>> module = grammar.parse('foo +\\\\nbar\\\\ncontinue')\\n    >>> error1, error2 = grammar.iter_errors(module)\\n    >>> error1.message\\n    'SyntaxError: invalid syntax'\\n    >>> error2.message\\n    \\\"SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop\\\"\\n\\nResources\\n=========\\n\\n- `Testing <https://parso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/development.html#testing>`_\\n- `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parso>`_\\n- `Docs <https://parso.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_\\n- Uses `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n    pip install parso\\n\\nFuture\\n======\\n\\n- There will be better support for refactoring and comments. Stay tuned.\\n- There's a WIP PEP8 validator. It's however not in a good shape, yet.\\n\\nKnown Issues\\n============\\n\\n- `async`/`await` are already used as keywords in Python3.6.\\n- `from __future__ import print_function` is not ignored.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n================\\n\\n- Guido van Rossum (@gvanrossum) for creating the parser generator pgen2\\n  (originally used in lib2to3).\\n- `Salome Schneider <https://www.crepes-schnaegg.ch/cr%C3%AApes-schn%C3%A4gg/kunst-f%C3%BCrs-cr%C3%AApes-mobil/>`_\\n  for the extremely awesome parso logo.\\n\\n\\n.. _jedi: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi\\n\\n\\n.. :changelog:\\n\\nChangelog\\n---------\\n\\nUnreleased\\n++++++++++\\n\\n0.8.4 (2024-04-05)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Add basic support for Python 3.13\\n\\n0.8.3 (2021-11-30)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Add basic support for Python 3.11 and 3.12\\n\\n0.8.2 (2021-03-30)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Various small bugfixes\\n\\n0.8.1 (2020-12-10)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Various small bugfixes\\n\\n0.8.0 (2020-08-05)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Dropped Support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5\\n- It's possible to use ``pathlib.Path`` objects now in the API\\n- The stubs are gone, we are now using annotations\\n- ``namedexpr_test`` nodes are now a proper class called ``NamedExpr``\\n- A lot of smaller refactorings\\n\\n0.7.1 (2020-07-24)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed a couple of smaller bugs (mostly syntax error detection in\\n  ``Grammar.iter_errors``)\\n\\nThis is going to be the last release that supports Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.\\n\\n0.7.0 (2020-04-13)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fix a lot of annoying bugs in the diff parser. The fuzzer did not find\\n  issues anymore even after running it for more than 24 hours (500k tests).\\n- Small grammar change: suites can now contain newlines even after a newline.\\n  This should really not matter if you don't use error recovery.

Colorama makes this work on\\nWindows, too, by wrapping ``stdout``, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which\\nwould appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the\\nappropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,\\nColorama does nothing.\\n\\nThis has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing\\ncolored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing\\napplications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on\\nLinux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling\\n``colorama.just_fix_windows_console()`` (since v0.4.6) or ``colorama.init()``\\n(all versions, but may have other side-effects – see below).\\n\\nAn alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows machines, which\\nprovides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals. Colorama\\nis intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g., maybe your app doesn't\\nhave an installer.)\\n\\nDemo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using\\nANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's built in ANSI\\nhandling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/ubuntu-demo.png\\n    :width: 661\\n    :height: 357\\n    :alt: ANSI sequences on Ubuntu under gnome-terminal.\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/windows-demo.png\\n    :width: 668\\n    :height: 325\\n    :alt: Same ANSI sequences on Windows, using Colorama.\\n\\nThese screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support ANSI 'dim\\ntext'; it looks the same as 'normal text'.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nInitialisation\\n..............\\n\\nIf the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work on\\nWindows, then run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\\n    just_fix_windows_console()\\n\\nIf you're on a recent version of Windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr\\nare pointing to a Windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration\\nswitch to enable Windows' built-in ANSI support.\\n\\nIf you're on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to\\na Windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr`` in a\\nmagic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues the\\nappropriate Win32 calls to emulate them.\\n\\nIn all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. Basically the idea is\\nthat this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to ANSI escape handling.\\n\\nIt's safe to call this function multiple times. It's safe to call this function\\non non-Windows platforms, but it won't do anything. It's safe to call this\\nfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file – it\\nwon't do anything to those streams.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more\\npotential footguns):\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import init\\n    init()\\n\\nThis does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for the\\nfollowing differences:\\n\\n- It's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up with multiple\\n  layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.\\n\\n- Colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,\\n  and if it thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and\\n  ``sys.stderr`` in a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences\\n  before printing them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if\\n  you want to write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and\\n  let Colorama decide whether they should actually be output. But note that\\n  Colorama's heuristic is not particularly clever.\\n\\n- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various\\n  functionality – see below.\\n\\nTo stop using Colorama before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.\\nThis will restore ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to their original values, so that\\nColorama is disabled. To resume using Colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it is\\ncheaper than calling ``init()`` again (but does the same thing).\\n\\nMost users should depend on ``colorama >= 0.4.6``, and use\\n``just_fix_windows_console``. The old ``init`` interface will be supported\\nindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to fix any issues\\nwith it, also for backwards compatibility.\\n\\nColored Output\\n..............\\n\\nCross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama's\\nconstant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberately\\nrudimentary, see below.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import Fore, Back, Style\\n    print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\\n    print(Back.GREEN + 'and with a green background')\\n    print(Style.DIM + 'and in dim text')\\n    print(Style.RESET_ALL)\\n    print('back to normal now')\\n\\n...or simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    print('\\\\033[31m' + 'some red text')\\n    print('\\\\033[39m') # and reset to default color\\n\\n...or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ANSI libraries\\nsuch as the venerable `Termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_\\nthe fabulous `Blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,\\nor the incredible `_Rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.\\n\\nIf you wish Colorama's Fore, Back and Style constants were more capable,\\nthen consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate\\ncolors, etc, and use Colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert\\nthose ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:\\n\\nSIMILARLY, do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.\\nWe are only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, not\\nshortcuts like the above to generate ANSI characters.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\\n    from termcolor import colored\\n\\n    # use Colorama to make Termcolor work on Windows too\\n    just_fix_windows_console()\\n\\n    # then use Termcolor for all colored text output\\n    print(colored('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red'))\\n\\nAvailable formatting constants are::\\n\\n    Fore: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\\n    Back: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\\n    Style: DIM, NORMAL, BRIGHT, RESET_ALL\\n\\n``Style.RESET_ALL`` resets foreground, background, and brightness. Colorama will\\nperform this reset automatically on program exit.\\n\\nThese are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard::\\n\\n    Fore: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\\n    Back: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\\n\\nCursor Positioning\\n..................\\n\\nANSI codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See ``demos/demo06.py`` for\\nan example of how to generate them.\\n\\nInit Keyword Args\\n.................\\n\\n``init()`` accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.\\n\\ninit(autoreset=False):\\n    If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color\\n    changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=True)`` will\\n    automate that:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: python\\n\\n        from colorama import init\\n        init(autoreset=True)\\n        print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\\n        print('automatically back to default color again')\\n\\ninit(strip=None):\\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether ANSI codes should be\\n    stripped from the output. The default behaviour is to strip if on Windows\\n    or if output is redirected (not a tty).\\n\\ninit(convert=None):\\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether to convert ANSI codes in the\\n    output into win32 calls. The default behaviour is to convert if on Windows\\n    and output is to a tty (terminal).\\n\\ninit(wrap=True):\\n    On Windows, Colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``\\n    with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their work.\\n    If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing\\n    ``init(wrap=False)``. The default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset`` or\\n    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are True.\\n\\n    When wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-Windows platforms will\\n    continue to work as normal. To do cross-platform colored output, you can\\n    use Colorama's ``AnsiToWin32`` proxy directly:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: python\\n\\n        import sys\\n        from colorama import init, AnsiToWin32\\n        init(wrap=False)\\n        stream = AnsiToWin32(sys.stderr).stream\\n\\n        # Python 2\\n        print >>stream, Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr'\\n\\n        # Python 3\\n        print(Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)\\n\\nRecognised ANSI Sequences\\n.........................\\n\\nANSI sequences generally take the form::\\n\\n    ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>\\n\\nWhere ``<param>`` is an integer, and ``<command>`` is a single letter. Zero or\\nmore params are passed to a ``<command>``. If no params are passed, it is\\ngenerally synonymous with passing a single zero. No spaces exist in the\\nsequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.\\n\\nThe only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls are::\\n\\n    ESC [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)\\n    ESC [ 1 m       # bright\\n    ESC [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)\\n    ESC [ 22 m      # normal brightness\\n\\n    # FOREGROUND:\\n    ESC [ 30 m      # black\\n    ESC [ 31 m      # red\\n    ESC [ 32 m      # green\\n    ESC [ 33 m      # yellow\\n    ESC [ 34 m      # blue\\n    ESC [ 35 m      # magenta\\n    ESC [ 36 m      # cyan\\n    ESC [ 37 m      # white\\n    ESC [ 39 m      # reset\\n\\n    # BACKGROUND\\n    ESC [ 40 m      # black\\n    ESC [ 41 m      # red\\n    ESC [ 42 m      # green\\n    ESC [ 43 m      # yellow\\n    ESC [ 44 m      # blue\\n    ESC [ 45 m      # magenta\\n    ESC [ 46 m      # cyan\\n    ESC [ 47 m      # white\\n    ESC [ 49 m      # reset\\n\\n    # cursor positioning\\n    ESC [ y;x H     # position cursor at x across, y down\\n    ESC [ y;x f     # position cursor at x across, y down\\n    ESC [ n A       # move cursor n lines up\\n    ESC [ n B       # move cursor n lines down\\n    ESC [ n C       # move cursor n characters forward\\n    ESC [ n D       # move cursor n characters backward\\n\\n    # clear the screen\\n    ESC [ mode J    # clear the screen\\n\\n    # clear the line\\n    ESC [ mode K    # clear the line\\n\\nMultiple numeric params to the ``'m'`` command can be combined into a single\\nsequence::\\n\\n    ESC [ 36 ; 45 ; 1 m     # bright cyan text on magenta background\\n\\nAll other ANSI sequences of the form ``ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>``\\nare silently stripped from the output on Windows.\\n\\nAny other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative\\ninitial characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to add\\nthem though. Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues on\\nGitHub.\\n\\nStatus & Known Problems\\n-----------------------\\n\\nI've personally only tested it on Windows XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu\\n(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.\\n\\nSome valid ANSI sequences aren't recognised.\\n\\nIf you're hacking on the code, see `README-hacking.md`_. ESPECIALLY, see the\\nexplanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow Colorama to generate new\\ntypes of ANSI codes.\\n\\nSee outstanding issues and wish-list:\\nhttps://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues\\n\\nIf anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,\\nI'd love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,\\nand would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patch\\nor two.\\n\\n.. _README-hacking.md: README-hacking.md\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\nCopyright Jonathan Hartley & Arnon Yaari, 2013-2020.

The _prebuilt_ extensions can be distributed\\nvia [PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=jupyterlab&o=-created&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter),\\nconda, and other package managers. The _source_ extensions can be installed\\ndirectly from npm (search for [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension)) but require an additional build step.\\nYou can also find JupyterLab extensions exploring GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension).\\nTo learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).\\n\\nRead the current JupyterLab documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\\n\\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n> JupyterLab 3 reached its end of maintenance date on May 15, 2024. Fixes for critical issues will still be backported until December 31, 2024. If you are still running JupyterLab 3, we strongly encourage you to **upgrade to JupyterLab 4 as soon as possible.** For more information, see [JupyterLab 3 end of maintenance](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-3-end-of-maintenance-879778927db2) on the Jupyter Blog.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nIf you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), you can install JupyterLab with one of the following commands.\\n\\n- If you use conda:\\n  ```shell\\n  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\\n  ```\\n- If you use mamba:\\n  ```shell\\n  mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\\n  ```\\n- If you use pip:\\n  ```shell\\n  pip install jupyterlab\\n  ```\\n  If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. If you are using a Unix derivative (e.g., FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, macOS), you can do this by running `export PATH=\\\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\\\"`.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook\\n\\nWhen using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run after installing JupyterLab to enable the JupyterLab server extension:\\n\\n```bash\\njupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix\\n```\\n\\n### Running\\n\\nStart up JupyterLab using:\\n\\n```bash\\njupyter lab\\n```\\n\\nJupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.\\n\\nIf you encounter an error like \\\"Command 'jupyter' not found\\\", please make sure `PATH` environment variable is set correctly. Alternatively, you can start up JupyterLab using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab` without changing the `PATH` environment variable.\\n\\n### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers\\n\\nThe latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:\\n\\n- Firefox\\n- Chrome\\n- Safari\\n\\nSee our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting help\\n\\nWe encourage you to ask questions on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.\\n\\n### Bug report\\n\\nTo report a bug please read the [guidelines](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/issue.html) and then open a [Github issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+status%3ANeeds+Triage&template=bug_report.md). To keep resolved issues self-contained, the [lock bot](https://github.com/apps/lock) will lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. If a related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.\\n\\n### Feature request\\n\\nWe also welcome suggestions for new features as they help make the project more useful for everyone. To request a feature please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=enhancement%2C+status%3ANeeds+Triage&template=feature_request.md).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n### Extending JupyterLab\\n\\nTo start developing an extension for JupyterLab, see the [developer documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_dev.html) and the [API docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/).\\n\\n### Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute code or documentation to JupyterLab itself, please read the [contributor documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/contributing.html).\\n\\nJupyterLab follows the Jupyter [Community Guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).\\n\\n### License\\n\\nJupyterLab uses a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\\ncopyright on their contributions.

The next time, the cached will be loaded and returned.\\n\\nWhen the source is changed, the DiskCache detects that the cached\\nfile is older, calls `parse` again storing and returning the new\\nresult.\\n\\nIn certain cases you would rather detect that the file has changed\\nby hashing the file. Simply use `DiskCacheByHash` instead of\\n`DiskCacheByMTime`.\\n\\nCached files are saved using the pickle protocol, and each has\\na companion json file with the header content.\\n\\nThis idea is completely flexible, and apply not only to parser.\\nIn **flexcache** we say there are two types of objects: **source object**\\nand **converted object**. The conversion function maps the former in\\nto the latter. The cache stores the latter by looking a customizable\\naspect of the former.\\n\\n\\nBuilding your own caching logic\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nIn certain cases you would like to customize how caching and\\ninvalidation is done.\\n\\nYou can achieve this by subclassing the `DiskCache`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from flexcache import DiskCache\\n    >>> class MyDiskCache(DiskCache):\\n    ...\\n    ...    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    ...    class MyHeader(NameByPathHeader, InvalidateByExist, BasicPythonHeader):\\n    ...         pass\\n    ...\\n    ...    _header_classes = {pathlib.Path: MyHeader}\\n\\nHere we created a custom Header class and use it to handle `pathlib.Path`\\nobjects. You can even have multiple headers registered in the same class\\nto handle different source object types.\\n\\nWe provide a convenient set of mixable classes to achieve almost any behavior.\\nThese are divided in three categories and you must choose at least one\\nfrom every kind.\\n\\nHeaders\\n~~~~~~~\\n\\nThese classes store the information that will be saved along side the cached file.\\n\\n- **BaseHeader**: source object and identifier of the converter function.\\n- **BasicPythonHeader**: source and identifier of the converter function,\\n  platform, python implementation, python version.\\n\\n\\nInvalidate\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThese classes define how the cache will decide if the cached converted object is an actual\\nrepresentation of the source object.\\n\\n- **InvalidateByExist**: the cached file must exists.\\n- **InvalidateByPathMTime**: the cached file exists and is newer than the source object\\n  (which has to be `pathlib.Path`)\\n- **InvalidateByMultiPathsMtime**: the cached file exists and is newer than the each path\\n  in the source object (which has to be `tuple[pathlib.Path]`)\\n\\n\\nNaming\\n~~~~~~\\n\\nThese classes define how the name is generated. The basename for the cache file is\\na hash hexdigest built by feeding a collection of values determined by the Header object.\\n\\n- **NameByFields**: all fields except the `source_object`.\\n- **NameByPath**: resolved path of the source object\\n  (which has to be `pathlib.Path`).\\n- **NameByMultiPaths**: resolved path of each path source object\\n  (which has to be `tuple[pathlib.Path]`), sorted in ascending order.\\n- **NameByFileContent**: the bytes content of the file referred by the source object\\n  (which has to be `pathlib.Path`).\\n- **NameByHashIter**: the values in the source object.\\n  (which has to be `tuple[str]`), sorted in ascending order\\n- **NameByObj**: the pickled version of the source object\\n  (which has to be pickable), using the highest available protocol.\\n  This also adds `pickle_protocol` to the header.\\n\\n\\nYou can mix and match as you see it fit, and of course, you can make your own.\\n\\nFinally, you can also avoid saving the header by setting the `_store_header`\\nclass attribute to `False`.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThis project was started as a part of Pint_, the python units package.\\n\\nSee AUTHORS_ for a list of the maintainers.\\n\\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\\nsee CHANGES_\\n\\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexcache/blob/main/AUTHORS\\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexcache/blob/main/CHANGES\\n.. _`Pint`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"![Build Status](https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)\\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/python-json-logger.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json-logger/)\\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/python-json-logger.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json-logger/)\\n\\nOverview\\n=======\\nThis library is provided to allow standard python logging to output log data as json objects. With JSON we can make our logs more readable by machines and we can stop writing custom parsers for syslog type records.\\n\\nNews\\n=======\\nHi, I see this package is quiet alive and I am sorry for ignoring it so long. I will be stepping up my maintenance of this package so please allow me a week to get things back in order (and most likely a new minor version) and I'll post and update here once I am caught up.\\n\\nInstalling\\n==========\\nPip:\\n\\n    pip install python-json-logger\\n\\nPypi:\\n\\n   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json-logger\\n\\nManual:\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\nUsage\\n=====\\n\\n## Integrating with Python's logging framework\\n\\nJson outputs are provided by the JsonFormatter logging formatter. You can add the custom formatter like below:\\n\\n**Please note: version 0.1.0 has changed the import structure, please update to the following example for proper importing**\\n\\n```python\\n    import logging\\n    from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger\\n\\n    logger = logging.getLogger()\\n\\n    logHandler = logging.StreamHandler()\\n    formatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter()\\n    logHandler.setFormatter(formatter)\\n    logger.addHandler(logHandler)\\n```\\n\\n## Customizing fields\\n\\nThe fmt parser can also be overidden if you want to have required fields that differ from the default of just `message`.\\n\\nThese two invocations are equivalent:\\n\\n```python\\nclass CustomJsonFormatter(jsonlogger.JsonFormatter):\\n    def parse(self):\\n        return self._fmt.split(';')\\n\\nformatter = CustomJsonFormatter('one;two')\\n\\n# is equivalent to:\\n\\nformatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter('%(one)s %(two)s')\\n```\\n\\nYou can also add extra fields to your json output by specifying a dict in place of message, as well as by specifying an `extra={}` argument.\\n\\nContents of these dictionaries will be added at the root level of the entry and may override basic fields.\\n\\nYou can also use the `add_fields` method to add to or generally normalize the set of default set of fields, it is called for every log event. For example, to unify default fields with those provided by [structlog](http://www.structlog.org/) you could do something like this:\\n\\n```python\\nclass CustomJsonFormatter(jsonlogger.JsonFormatter):\\n    def add_fields(self, log_record, record, message_dict):\\n        super(CustomJsonFormatter, self).add_fields(log_record, record, message_dict)\\n        if not log_record.get('timestamp'):\\n            # this doesn't use record.created, so it is slightly off\\n            now = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')\\n            log_record['timestamp'] = now\\n        if log_record.get('level'):\\n            log_record['level'] = log_record['level'].upper()\\n        else:\\n            log_record['level'] = record.levelname\\n\\nformatter = CustomJsonFormatter('%(timestamp)s %(level)s %(name)s %(message)s')\\n```\\n\\nItems added to the log record will be included in *every* log message, no matter what the format requires.\\n\\n## Adding custom object serialization\\n\\nFor custom handling of object serialization you can specify default json object translator or provide a custom encoder\\n\\n```python\\ndef json_translate(obj):\\n    if isinstance(obj, MyClass):\\n        return {\\\"special\\\": obj.special}\\n\\nformatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter(json_default=json_translate,\\n                                     json_encoder=json.JSONEncoder)\\nlogHandler.setFormatter(formatter)\\n\\nlogger.info({\\\"special\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"run\\\": 12})\\nlogger.info(\\\"classic message\\\", extra={\\\"special\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"run\\\": 12})\\n```\\n\\n## Using a Config File\\n\\nTo use the module with a config file using the [`fileConfig` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.fileConfig), use the class `pythonjsonlogger.jsonlogger.JsonFormatter`. Here is a sample config file.\\n\\n```ini\\n[loggers]\\nkeys = root,custom\\n\\n[logger_root]\\nhandlers =\\n\\n[logger_custom]\\nlevel = INFO\\nhandlers = custom\\nqualname = custom\\n\\n[handlers]\\nkeys = custom\\n\\n[handler_custom]\\nclass = StreamHandler\\nlevel = INFO\\nformatter = json\\nargs = (sys.stdout,)\\n\\n[formatters]\\nkeys = json\\n\\n[formatter_json]\\nformat = %(message)s\\nclass = pythonjsonlogger.jsonlogger.JsonFormatter\\n```\\n\\nExample Output\\n==============\\n\\nSample JSON with a full formatter (basically the log message from the unit test). Every log message will appear on 1 line like a typical logger.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"threadName\\\": \\\"MainThread\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"root\\\",\\n    \\\"thread\\\": 140735202359648,\\n    \\\"created\\\": 1336281068.506248,\\n    \\\"process\\\": 41937,\\n    \\\"processName\\\": \\\"MainProcess\\\",\\n    \\\"relativeCreated\\\": 9.100914001464844,\\n    \\\"module\\\": \\\"tests\\\",\\n    \\\"funcName\\\": \\\"testFormatKeys\\\",\\n    \\\"levelno\\\": 20,\\n    \\\"msecs\\\": 506.24799728393555,\\n    \\\"pathname\\\": \\\"tests/tests.py\\\",\\n    \\\"lineno\\\": 60,\\n    \\\"asctime\\\": [\\\"12-05-05 22:11:08,506248\\\"],\\n    \\\"message\\\": \\\"testing logging format\\\",\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"tests.py\\\",\\n    \\\"levelname\\\": \\\"INFO\\\",\\n    \\\"special\\\": \\\"value\\\",\\n    \\\"run\\\": 12\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExternal Examples\\n=================\\n\\n- [Wesley Tanaka - Structured log files in Python using python-json-logger](http://web.archive.org/web/20201130054012/https://wtanaka.com/node/8201)\\n\\n- [Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130054012/https://wtanaka.com/node/8201)\\n\",\n",

An attacker can also keep\\nCPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request. Under some\\ncircumstances it is even possible to access local files on your\\nserver, to circumvent a firewall, or to abuse services to rebound attacks to\\nthird parties.\\n\\nThe attacks use and abuse less common features of XML and its parsers. The\\nmajority of developers are unacquainted with features such as processing\\ninstructions and entity expansions that XML inherited from SGML. At best\\nthey know about ``<!DOCTYPE>`` from experience with HTML but they are not\\naware that a document type definition (DTD) can generate an HTTP request\\nor load a file from the file system.\\n\\nNone of the issues is new. They have been known for a long time. Billion\\nlaughs was first reported in 2003. Nevertheless some XML libraries and\\napplications are still vulnerable and even heavy users of XML are\\nsurprised by these features. It's hard to say whom to blame for the\\nsituation. It's too short sighted to shift all blame on XML parsers and\\nXML libraries for using insecure default settings. After all they\\nproperly implement XML specifications. Application developers must not rely\\nthat a library is always configured for security and potential harmful data\\nby default.\\n\\n\\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\\n   :depth: 2\\n\\n\\nAttack vectors\\n==============\\n\\nbillion laughs / exponential entity expansion\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe `Billion Laughs`_ attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion --\\nuses multiple levels of nested entities. The original example uses 9 levels\\nof 10 expansions in each level to expand the string ``lol`` to a string of\\n3 * 10 :sup:`9` bytes, hence the name \\\"billion laughs\\\". The resulting string\\noccupies 3 GB (2.79 GiB) of memory; intermediate strings require additional\\nmemory. Because most parsers don't cache the intermediate step for every\\nexpansion it is repeated over and over again. It increases the CPU load even\\nmore.\\n\\nAn XML document of just a few hundred bytes can disrupt all services on a\\nmachine within seconds.\\n\\nExample XML::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [\\n    <!ENTITY a \\\"1234567890\\\" >\\n    <!ENTITY b \\\"&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;\\\">\\n    <!ENTITY c \\\"&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;\\\">\\n    <!ENTITY d \\\"&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <bomb>&d;</bomb>\\n\\n\\nquadratic blowup entity expansion\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nA quadratic blowup attack is similar to a `Billion Laughs`_ attack; it abuses\\nentity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entity\\nwith a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack isn't as\\nefficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering countermeasures of\\nparsers against heavily nested entities. Some parsers limit the depth and\\nbreadth of a single entity but not the total amount of expanded text\\nthroughout an entire XML document.\\n\\nA medium-sized XML document with a couple of hundred kilobytes can require a\\ncouple of hundred MB to several GB of memory. When the attack is combined\\nwith some level of nested expansion an attacker is able to achieve a higher\\nratio of success.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE bomb [\\n    <!ENTITY a \\\"xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <bomb>&a;&a;&a;... repeat</bomb>\\n\\n\\nexternal entity expansion (remote)\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nEntity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They can\\nalso point to external resources by public identifiers or system identifiers.\\nSystem identifiers are standard URIs. When the URI is a URL (e.g. a\\n``http://`` locator) some parsers download the resource from the remote\\nlocation and embed them into the XML document verbatim.\\n\\nSimple example of a parsed external entity::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE external [\\n    <!ENTITY ee SYSTEM \\\"http://www.python.org/some.xml\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <root>&ee;</root>\\n\\nThe case of parsed external entities works only for valid XML content. The\\nXML standard also supports unparsed external entities with a\\n``NData declaration``.\\n\\nExternal entity expansion opens the door to plenty of exploits. An attacker\\ncan abuse a vulnerable XML library and application to rebound and forward\\nnetwork requests with the IP address of the server. It highly depends\\non the parser and the application what kind of exploit is possible. For\\nexample:\\n\\n* An attacker can circumvent firewalls and gain access to restricted\\n  resources as all the requests are made from an internal and trustworthy\\n  IP address, not from the outside.\\n* An attacker can abuse a service to attack, spy on or DoS your servers but\\n  also third party services. The attack is disguised with the IP address of\\n  the server and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big\\n  machine.\\n* An attacker can exhaust additional resources on the machine, e.g. with\\n  requests to a service that doesn't respond or responds with very large\\n  files.\\n* An attacker may gain knowledge, when, how often and from which IP address\\n  an XML document is accessed.\\n* An attacker could send mail from inside your network if the URL handler\\n  supports ``smtp://`` URIs.\\n\\n\\nexternal entity expansion (local file)\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nExternal entities with references to local files are a sub-case of external\\nentity expansion. It's listed as an extra attack because it deserves extra\\nattention. Some XML libraries such as lxml disable network access by default\\nbut still allow entity expansion with local file access by default. Local\\nfiles are either referenced with a ``file://`` URL or by a file path (either\\nrelative or absolute).\\n\\nAn attacker may be able to access and download all files that can be read by\\nthe application process. This may include critical configuration files, too.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE external [\\n    <!ENTITY ee SYSTEM \\\"file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <root>&ee;</root>\\n\\n\\nDTD retrieval\\n-------------\\n\\nThis case is similar to external entity expansion, too. Some XML libraries\\nlike Python's xml.dom.pulldom retrieve document type definitions from remote\\nor local locations. Several attack scenarios from the external entity case\\napply to this issue as well.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    <?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\\\"\\n      \\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\\\">\\n    <html>\\n        <head/>\\n        <body>text</body>\\n    </html>\\n\\n\\nPython XML Libraries\\n====================\\n\\n.. csv-table:: vulnerabilities and features\\n   :header: \\\"kind\\\", \\\"sax\\\", \\\"etree\\\", \\\"minidom\\\", \\\"pulldom\\\", \\\"xmlrpc\\\", \\\"lxml\\\", \\\"genshi\\\"\\n   :widths: 24, 7, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8\\n   :stub-columns: 0\\n\\n   \\\"billion laughs\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (1)\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"quadratic blowup\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"external entity expansion (remote)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (3)\\\", \\\"False (4)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"False (1)\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"external entity expansion (local file)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (3)\\\", \\\"False (4)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"DTD retrieval\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"False (1)\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"gzip bomb\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**partly** (2)\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"xpath support (7)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"xsl(t) support (7)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"xinclude support (7)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True** (6)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True** (6)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\"\\n   \\\"C library\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"libxml2\\\", \\\"expat\\\"\\n\\n1.

Merely `defusedxml.xmlrpc`_ is implemented as monkey patch.\\n\\nInstead of::\\n\\n   >>> from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse\\n   >>> et = parse(xmlfile)\\n\\nalter code to::\\n\\n   >>> from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse\\n   >>> et = parse(xmlfile)\\n\\nAdditionally the package has an **untested** function to monkey patch\\nall stdlib modules with ``defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()``.\\n\\nAll functions and parser classes accept three additional keyword arguments.\\nThey return either the same objects as the original functions or compatible\\nsubclasses.\\n\\nforbid_dtd (default: False)\\n  disallow XML with a ``<!DOCTYPE>`` processing instruction and raise a\\n  *DTDForbidden* exception when a DTD processing instruction is found.\\n\\nforbid_entities (default: True)\\n  disallow XML with ``<!ENTITY>`` declarations inside the DTD and raise an\\n  *EntitiesForbidden* exception when an entity is declared.\\n\\nforbid_external (default: True)\\n  disallow any access to remote or local resources in external entities\\n  or DTD and raising an *ExternalReferenceForbidden* exception when a DTD\\n  or entity references an external resource.\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml (package)\\n--------------------\\n\\nDefusedXmlException, DTDForbidden, EntitiesForbidden,\\nExternalReferenceForbidden, NotSupportedError\\n\\ndefuse_stdlib() (*experimental*)\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml.cElementTree\\n-----------------------\\n\\n**NOTE** ``defusedxml.cElementTree`` is deprecated and will be removed in a\\nfuture release.

The function `monkey_patch()` enables the fixes,\\n`unmonkey_patch()` removes the patch and puts the code in its former state.\\n\\nThe monkey patch protects against XML related attacks as well as\\ndecompression bombs and excessively large requests or responses. The default\\nsetting is 30 MB for requests, responses and gzip decompression. You can\\nmodify the default by changing the module variable `MAX_DATA`. A value of\\n`-1` disables the limit.\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml.lxml\\n---------------\\n\\n**DEPRECATED** The module is deprecated and will be removed in a future\\nrelease.\\n\\nThe module acts as an *example* how you could protect code that uses\\nlxml.etree. It implements a custom Element class that filters out\\nEntity instances, a custom parser factory and a thread local storage for\\nparser instances. It also has a check_docinfo() function which inspects\\na tree for internal or external DTDs and entity declarations.

A counter starts when an entity reference\\n   is encountered. It resets after the entity is fully expanded. The limit\\n   protects the parser against exponential entity expansion attacks (aka\\n   billion laughs attack). When the limit is exceeded the parser stops and\\n   fails with `XML_ERROR_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS`.\\n   A value of 0 disables the protection.\\n\\n   Supported range\\n     0 ..

I have compiled an incomplete list of theoretical issues that\\nneed further research and more attention. The list is deliberately pessimistic\\nand a bit paranoid, too. It contains things that might go wrong under daffy\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n\\nattribute blowup / hash collision attack\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nXML parsers may use an algorithm with quadratic runtime O(n :sup:`2`) to\\nhandle attributes and namespaces. If it uses hash tables (dictionaries) to\\nstore attributes and namespaces the implementation may be vulnerable to\\nhash collision attacks, thus reducing the performance to O(n :sup:`2`) again.\\nIn either case an attacker is able to forge a denial of service attack with\\nan XML document that contains thousands upon thousands of attributes in\\na single node.\\n\\nI haven't researched yet if expat, pyexpat or libxml2 are vulnerable.\\n\\n\\ndecompression bomb\\n------------------\\n\\nThe issue of decompression bombs (aka `ZIP bomb`_) apply to all XML libraries\\nthat can parse compressed XML stream like gzipped HTTP streams or LZMA-ed\\nfiles. For an attacker it can reduce the amount of transmitted data by three\\nmagnitudes or more. Gzip is able to compress 1 GiB zeros to roughly 1 MB,\\nlzma is even better::\\n\\n    $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | gzip > zeros.gz\\n    $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | lzma -z > zeros.xy\\n    $ ls -sh zeros.*\\n    1020K zeros.gz\\n     148K zeros.xy\\n\\nNone of Python's standard XML libraries decompress streams except for\\n``xmlrpclib``. The module is vulnerable <https://bugs.python.org/issue16043>\\nto decompression bombs.\\n\\nlxml can load and process compressed data through libxml2 transparently.\\nlibxml2 can handle even very large blobs of compressed data efficiently\\nwithout using too much memory. But it doesn't protect applications from\\ndecompression bombs. A carefully written SAX or iterparse-like approach can\\nbe safe.\\n\\n\\nProcessing Instruction\\n----------------------\\n\\n`PI`_'s like::\\n\\n  <?xml-stylesheet type=\\\"text/xsl\\\" href=\\\"style.xsl\\\"?>\\n\\nmay impose more threats for XML processing. It depends if and how a\\nprocessor handles processing instructions. The issue of URL retrieval with\\nnetwork or local file access apply to processing instructions, too.\\n\\n\\nOther DTD features\\n------------------\\n\\n`DTD`_ has more features like ``<!NOTATION>``. I haven't researched how\\nthese features may be a security threat.\\n\\n\\nXPath\\n-----\\n\\nXPath statements may introduce DoS vulnerabilities. Code should never execute\\nqueries from untrusted sources. An attacker may also be able to create an XML\\ndocument that makes certain XPath queries costly or resource hungry.\\n\\n\\nXPath injection attacks\\n-----------------------\\n\\nXPath injeciton attacks pretty much work like SQL injection attacks.\\nArguments to XPath queries must be quoted and validated properly, especially\\nwhen they are taken from the user. The page `Avoid the dangers of XPath injection`_\\nlist some ramifications of XPath injections.\\n\\nPython's standard library doesn't have XPath support. Lxml supports\\nparameterized XPath queries which does proper quoting. You just have to use\\nits xpath() method correctly::\\n\\n   # DON'T\\n   >>> tree.xpath(\\\"/tag[@id='%s']\\\" % value)\\n\\n   # instead do\\n   >>> tree.xpath(\\\"/tag[@id=$tagid]\\\", tagid=name)\\n\\n\\nXInclude\\n--------\\n\\n`XML Inclusion`_ is another way to load and include external files::\\n\\n   <root xmlns:xi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\\\">\\n     <xi:include href=\\\"filename.txt\\\" parse=\\\"text\\\" />\\n   </root>\\n\\nThis feature should be disabled when XML files from an untrusted source are\\nprocessed. Some Python XML libraries and libxml2 support XInclude but don't\\nhave an option to sandbox inclusion and limit it to allowed directories.\\n\\n\\nXMLSchema location\\n------------------\\n\\nA validating XML parser may download schema files from the information in a\\n``xsi:schemaLocation`` attribute.\\n\\n::\\n\\n  <ead xmlns=\\\"urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9\\\"\\n       xmlns:xsi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\\"\\n       xsi:schemaLocation=\\\"urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9 http://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.xsd\\\">\\n  </ead>\\n\\n\\nXSL Transformation\\n------------------\\n\\nYou should keep in mind that XSLT is a Turing complete language. Never\\nprocess XSLT code from unknown or untrusted source! XSLT processors may\\nallow you to interact with external resources in ways you can't even imagine.\\nSome processors even support extensions that allow read/write access to file\\nsystem, access to JRE objects or scripting with Jython.\\n\\nExample from `Attacking XML Security`_ for Xalan-J::\\n\\n    <xsl:stylesheet version=\\\"1.0\\\"\\n     xmlns:xsl=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\\\"\\n     xmlns:rt=\\\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Runtime\\\"\\n     xmlns:ob=\\\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Object\\\"\\n     exclude-result-prefixes= \\\"rt ob\\\">\\n     <xsl:template match=\\\"/\\\">\\n       <xsl:variable name=\\\"runtimeObject\\\" select=\\\"rt:getRuntime()\\\"/>\\n       <xsl:variable name=\\\"command\\\"\\n         select=\\\"rt:exec($runtimeObject, &apos;c:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe&apos;)\\\"/>\\n       <xsl:variable name=\\\"commandAsString\\\" select=\\\"ob:toString($command)\\\"/>\\n       <xsl:value-of select=\\\"$commandAsString\\\"/>\\n     </xsl:template>\\n    </xsl:stylesheet>\\n\\n\\nRelated CVEs\\n============\\n\\nCVE-2013-1664\\n  Unrestricted entity expansion induces DoS vulnerabilities in Python XML\\n  libraries (XML bomb)\\n\\nCVE-2013-1665\\n  External entity expansion in Python XML libraries inflicts potential\\n  security flaws and DoS vulnerabilities\\n\\n\\nOther languages / frameworks\\n=============================\\n\\nSeveral other programming languages and frameworks are vulnerable as well. A\\ncouple of them are affected by the fact that libxml2 up to 2.9.0 has no\\nprotection against quadratic blowup attacks. Most of them have potential\\ndangerous default settings for entity expansion and external entities, too.\\n\\nPerl\\n----\\n\\nPerl's XML::Simple is vulnerable to quadratic entity expansion and external\\nentity expansion (both local and remote).\\n\\n\\nRuby\\n----\\n\\nRuby's REXML document parser is vulnerable to entity expansion attacks\\n(both quadratic and exponential) but it doesn't do external entity\\nexpansion by default. In order to counteract entity expansion you have to\\ndisable the feature::\\n\\n  REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 0\\n\\nlibxml-ruby and hpricot don't expand entities in their default configuration.\\n\\n\\nPHP\\n---\\n\\nPHP's SimpleXML API is vulnerable to quadratic entity expansion and loads\\nentities from local and remote resources. The option ``LIBXML_NONET`` disables\\nnetwork access but still allows local file access. ``LIBXML_NOENT`` seems to\\nhave no effect on entity expansion in PHP 5.4.6.\\n\\n\\nC# / .NET / Mono\\n----------------\\n\\nInformation in `XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN)`_ suggest that .NET is\\nvulnerable with its default settings. The article contains code snippets\\nhow to create a secure XML reader::\\n\\n  XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();\\n  settings.ProhibitDtd = false;\\n  settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;\\n  settings.XmlResolver = null;\\n  XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);\\n\\n\\nJava\\n----\\n\\nUntested. The documentation of Xerces and its `Xerces SecurityMananger`_\\nsounds like Xerces is also vulnerable to billion laugh attacks with its\\ndefault settings. It also does entity resolving when an\\n``org.xml.sax.EntityResolver`` is configured. I'm not yet sure about the\\ndefault setting here.\\n\\nJava specialists suggest to have a custom builder factory::\\n\\n  DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\\n  builderFactory.setXIncludeAware(False);\\n  builderFactory.setExpandEntityReferences(False);\\n  builderFactory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, True);\\n  # either\\n  builderFactory.setFeature(\\\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\\\", True);\\n  # or if you need DTDs\\n  builderFactory.setFeature(\\\"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities\\\", False);\\n  builderFactory.setFeature(\\\"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities\\\", False);\\n  builderFactory.setFeature(\\\"http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd\\\", False);\\n  builderFactory.setFeature(\\\"http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-dtd-grammar\\\", False);\\n\\n\\nTODO\\n====\\n\\n* DOM: Use xml.dom.xmlbuilder options for entity handling\\n* SAX: take feature_external_ges and feature_external_pes (?) into account\\n* test experimental monkey patching of stdlib modules\\n* improve documentation\\n\\n\\nLicense\\n=======\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2013-2017 by Christian Heimes <christian@python.org>\\n\\nLicensed to PSF under a Contributor Agreement.\\n\\nSee https://www.python.org/psf/license for licensing details.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n================\\n\\nBrett Cannon (Python Core developer)\\n  review and code cleanup\\n\\nAntoine Pitrou (Python Core developer)\\n  code review\\n\\nAaron Patterson, Ben Murphy and Michael Koziarski (Ruby community)\\n  Many thanks to Aaron, Ben and Michael from the Ruby community for their\\n  report and assistance.\\n\\nThierry Carrez (OpenStack)\\n  Many thanks to Thierry for his report to the Python Security Response\\n  Team on behalf of the OpenStack security team.\\n\\nCarl Meyer (Django)\\n  Many thanks to Carl for his report to PSRT on behalf of the Django security\\n  team.\\n\\nDaniel Veillard (libxml2)\\n  Many thanks to Daniel for his insight and assistance with libxml2.\\n\\nsemantics GmbH (https://www.semantics.de/)\\n  Many thanks to my employer semantics for letting me work on the issue\\n  during working hours as part of semantics's open source initiative.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n==========\\n\\n* `XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN)`_\\n* `Billion Laughs`_ on Wikipedia\\n* `ZIP bomb`_ on Wikipedia\\n* `Configure SAX parsers for secure processing`_\\n* `Testing for XML Injection`_\\n\\n.. _defusedxml package: https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml\\n.. _defusedxml on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml\\n.. _defusedexpat package: https://github.com/tiran/defusedexpat\\n.. _defusedexpat on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedexpat\\n.. _modified expat: https://github.com/tiran/expat\\n.. _expat parser: http://expat.sourceforge.net/\\n.. _Attacking XML Security: https://www.isecpartners.com/media/12976/iSEC-HILL-Attacking-XML-Security-bh07.pdf\\n.. _Billion Laughs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs\\n.. _XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx\\n.. _ZIP bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb\\n.. _DTD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition\\n.. _PI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_Instruction\\n.. _Avoid the dangers of XPath injection: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xpathinjection/index.html\\n.. _Configure SAX parsers for secure processing: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html\\n.. _Testing for XML Injection: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_XML_Injection_(OWASP-DV-008)\\n.. _Xerces SecurityMananger: https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/javadocs/xerces2/org/apache/xerces/util/SecurityManager.html\\n.. _XML Inclusion: https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_element\\n\\nChangelog\\n=========\\n\\ndefusedxml 0.7.1\\n---------------------\\n\\n*Release date: 08-Mar-2021*\\n\\n- Fix regression ``defusedxml.ElementTree.ParseError`` (#63)\\n  The ``ParseError`` exception is now the same class object as\\n  ``xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError`` again.\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml 0.7.0\\n----------------\\n\\n*Release date: 4-Mar-2021*\\n\\n- No changes\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml 0.7.0rc2\\n-------------------\\n\\n*Release date: 12-Jan-2021*\\n\\n- Re-add and deprecate ``defusedxml.cElementTree``\\n- Use GitHub Actions instead of TravisCI\\n- Restore ``ElementTree`` attribute of ``xml.etree`` module after patching\\n\\ndefusedxml 0.7.0rc1\\n-------------------\\n\\n*Release date: 04-May-2020*\\n\\n- Add support for Python 3.9\\n- ``defusedxml.cElementTree`` is not available with Python 3.9.\\n- Python 2 is deprecate.

If the [Open Force Field toolkit](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield) is installed, it will automatically detect and use this entry point:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from openforcefield.typing.engines.smirnoff import ForceField\\n>>> ff = ForceField('smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.9.offxml') \\n```\\n\\nOtherwise, the entry point can be accessed by querying the `openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory` entry point group.\\n\\n```\\n>>> from pkg_resources import iter_entry_points\\n>>> for entry_point in iter_entry_points(group='openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory'):\\n...     print(entry_point.load()())\\n```\\n\\n## What it is\\n\\nThe provided OFFXML (force field) files are successive versions of a general-purpose small molecule force field, written in [the SMIRNOFF format](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/blob/master/The-SMIRNOFF-force-field-format.md); this force field should cover all or almost all of drug-like chemical space, and illustrate some of the major functionality of the SMIRNOFF format as well as how it simplifies the specification of force field parameters in a compact and chemically sensible way.\\n\\nHOWEVER, this is not expected to be (at present) an especially accurate small molecule force field.\\nIts authors (see History, below) expect that while coverage will initially be good, additional refinements will be required (and possibly some expansion of the number of parameters) before it can rival current force fields such as GAFF or OPLS in accuracy.\\nHowever, we are optimistic that it already rivals them in extensibility, and potentially with relatively minimal work can be extended to be a compelling present-day small molecule force field.\\n\\nAs with typical members of the AMBER force field family, SMIRNOFF99Frosst is intended to be used with RESP or AM1-BCC charges which are not specified by the force field itself.\\n\\n**Differences from parm99 and parm@frosst**:\\n\\nSMIRNOFF99Frosst is neither parm99 nor parm@frosst exactly, for a number of reasons including that:\\n\\n- It covers, or should cover with only slight modification, all reasonable organic chemistry, which neither of the above did\\n- It is much simpler (because of parameter consolidation by SMIRKS, because of removing questionably differentiated parameters, and because its goal is to be a \\\"good starting point\\\" than a finished product)\\n- It introduces a number of approximations/consolidations for conciseness/clarity\\n- It fixes a number of mistakes/omissions, etc.\\n\\nThe second and third bullet points are particularly important.\\nWhen many parameters (such as torsional barrier heights, or equlibrium angles) for similar chemical functionality differed only slightly in the existing force fields, these were often deliberately consolidated to have a single value.\\n\\nThe last bullet point is also noteworthy.\\nBecause of limitations of atom typing, many torsions were missing in parm99/parm@frosst, resulting in generics being erroneously applied when a more specialized torsion could have served.\\nThe use of SMIRKS typically means that this is not the case, so many mistakes are eliminated.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThis forcefield, SMIRNOFF99Frosst, is a logical descendant of AMBER's parm99 forcefield as well as Merck-Frosst's [parm@frosst](http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/parm_at_Frosst/), but is generalized/simplified and put into the SMIRNOFF format.\\n\\nSMIRNOFF99Frosst was created by Christopher I. Bayly (with help from Caitlin C. Bannan and David L. Mobley, UC Irvine) during his sabbatical at UCI during Summer 2016.\\nIt was created by hand curation of the original parm99 and parm@frosst parameter and frcmod files (manually creating SMIRKS patterns, condensing parameters, etc.).\\nUsage of SMIRKS, along with application of Bayly's chemical intuition and extensive history with the AMBER force field family, allowed the number of parameter lines to be reduced from the multiple thousands of parm99+parm@frosst to the few hundred seen here.\\n\\n## Tentative plan\\n\\nWe expect to continue to manually expand this to cover more chemical space and, when needed, to introduce additional parameters to improve accuracy.\\nSubsequent versions are expected to build on Bayly's hand created version with some enhancements by Caitlin Bannan by improving specific parameters, further differentiating some chemical functionality, etc.\\nHowever, derivatives are expected to retain this basic structure and the AMBER legacy/history; a full refitting of bonded parameters would result in a separate force field rather than a new version of this force field.\\n\\nIn general, this repository will only contain force fields that aim to reproduce the behavior of parm99/parm@Frosst using the SMIRNOFF format. \\nOnce the Open Force Field Initiative begins parameter optimizations, the resulting force field should be migrated to separate base name.\\n\\n## General versioning guidelines\\n\\n_Applicable in general to SMIRNOFF-format FFs produced by the Open Force Field Consortium_\\n\\nForce fields moving forward will be called `name-X.Y.Z`\\n\\n* `X` denotes some major change in functional form.\\n* `Y` is the parameterization epoch / generation, or a minor change that can affect energy.\\n* `Z` is a bugfix version -- e.g. something we've caught and corrected.  \\n\\n## Using SMIRNOFF99Frosst\\n\\nIn OpenMM, application of SMIRNOFF99Frosst to small molecules should be straightforward via `openforcefield` with examples available in the [openforcefield repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/tree/master/examples).\\nAdditionally, with ParmEd, it should be possible to convert parameterized OpenMM systems into other formats such as AMBER, CHARMM, or GROMACS, making this forcefield available in a variety of packages.\\n\\n\\n## Versions\\n- Version 1.0/[Version 1.0.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154235) (equivalent): Initial release after hand curation by C. I. Bayly and C. C. Bannan. DOI [10.5281/zenodo.154235](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154235)\\n- [Version 1.0.2](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154555): Fixes an out-of-order generic (bond `[#6X2:1]-[#6:2]`) as per [Issue 4](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/4).\\n- [Version 1.0.3](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.161616): Bug fixes -- adding one omitted bond length, fixing four torsional smirks patterns, and adding one missing torsional term as detailed in [smarty issue 164](https://github.com/openforcefield/smarty/pull/164)\\n- [Version 1.0.4](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.348165): Bug fixes --  #11: Fix the parm@Frosst-derived C-OS bond length so it does not also match (and thus override) C-OH, switching from SMIRKS of `[#6X3:1](=[#8X1])-[#8X2:2]` to `[#6X3:1](=[#8X1])-[#8X2H0:2]`, which avoids overriding `[#6X3:1]-[#8X2H1:2]`. And then add back in a generic which should have been present ([PR 15](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/pull/15), fixing a bug introduced by [PR 11](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/pull/11))\\n- [Version 1.0.5](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.495249): Substantially improved coverage of chemical space via more general generics as well as a variety of new parameters introduced via generalization/estimation from other force fields such as GAFF/GAFF2. This release, this version covers an internal set of molecules from DrugBank filtered to remove metal atoms and to contain only compounds with less than 200 heavy atoms. Full documentation of changes is available [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/smarty/pull/232).\\n- [Version 1.0.6](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1093346): Added monovalent ion parameters (Joung/Cheatham) for TIP3P as default. Added angle parameters for cyclobutyl groups. Replaced `R` decorators with `x` to guarantee compatibility between OpenEye toolkits and RDKit SMIRKS parsing.\\n- [Version 1.0.7](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186466): Add hydroxyl hydrogen radii (as per SMIRNOFF initial paper); remove generics with pure wildcards (not even elemental types).\\n- [Version 1.0.8](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2565295): Fix human error in hydroxyl hydrogens; fix bond parameters between hydrogen and divalent carbons ([issue #81](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/81)); and fixed SMIRKS patterns for angle parameters around trivalent carbon in 5-membered rings ([issue #84](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/84)).\\n- [Version 1.0.9](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3256444): Addresses [issue 89](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/89): Fixes torsion t56, where SMIRKS `[!1:1]-[#7X4,#7X3:2]-[#6X4;r3:3]-[*:4]` should be `[!#1:1]-[#7X4,#7X3:2]-[#6X4;r3:3]-[*:4]`. The first means \\\"not an isotope with mass 1\\\" (`!1`), but we intend for it to apply to all hydrogens, so it has been changed to `!#1`.\\n- Version 1.1.0: Adds hydrogen bond constraints. Updates contents to SMIRNOFF 0.3 spec (spec change performed by OFF toolkit 0.4.0 reading smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.9, and then writing the `ForceField` object out in the 0.3 spec). Fixes several issues with FF hierarchy, SMIRKS patterns. This fixes some issues with coverage of certain areas of chemical space, and parameters which could never be utilized due to hierarchy issues.

penalties.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.\\nThe classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.\\n\\nCheck out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for an in-depth explanation!\\n\\n\\n### Hate Type Annotations!?\\n\\nNo problem!\\nTypes are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.\\nSimply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom attrs import define, field\\n\\n@define\\nclass SomeClass:\\n    a_number = field(default=42)\\n    list_of_numbers = field(factory=list)\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Data Classes\\n\\nOn the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).\\nIn practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.\\nFor instance, it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization), has a replacement for `__init_subclass__`, and allows for stepping through the generated methods using a debugger.\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes), but generally speaking, we are more likely to commit crimes against nature to make things work that one would expect to work, but that are quite complicated in practice.\\n\\n\\n## Project Information\\n\\n-

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\\nits way towards this goal.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Main Features](#main-features)\\n- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\\n- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\\n- [License](#license)\\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\\n- [Background](#background)\\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\\n- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\\n- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\\n\\n## Main Features\\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\\n\\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\\n    objects\\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\\n    align the data for you in computations\\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\\n    and transforming data\\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\\n    into DataFrame objects\\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\\n    large data sets\\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\\n    sets\\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\\n    data sets\\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\\n    labels per tick)\\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\\n    date shifting and lagging\\n\\n\\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\\n\\n## Where to get it\\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\\n\\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\\n\\n```sh\\n# conda\\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas\\n```\\n\\n```sh\\n# or PyPI\\npip install pandas\\n```\\n\\nThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

      "            \"description\": \"# xmltodict\\n\\n`xmltodict` is a Python module that makes working with XML feel like you are working with [JSON](http://docs.python.org/library/json.html), as in this [\\\"spec\\\"](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/05/31/converting-between-xml-and-json.html):\\n\\n[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/martinblech/xmltodict.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/martinblech/xmltodict)\\n\\n```python\\n>>> print(json.dumps(xmltodict.parse(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n...  <mydocument has=\\\"an attribute\\\">\\n...    <and>\\n...      <many>elements</many>\\n...      <many>more elements</many>\\n...    </and>\\n...    <plus a=\\\"complex\\\">\\n...      element as well\\n...    </plus>\\n...  </mydocument>\\n...  \\\"\\\"\\\"), indent=4))\\n{\\n    \\\"mydocument\\\": {\\n        \\\"@has\\\": \\\"an attribute\\\", \\n        \\\"and\\\": {\\n            \\\"many\\\": [\\n                \\\"elements\\\", \\n                \\\"more elements\\\"\\n            ]\\n        }, \\n        \\\"plus\\\": {\\n            \\\"@a\\\": \\\"complex\\\", \\n            \\\"#text\\\": \\\"element as well\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Namespace support\\n\\nBy default, `xmltodict` does no XML namespace processing (it just treats namespace declarations as regular node attributes), but passing `process_namespaces=True` will make it expand namespaces for you:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> xml = \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n... <root xmlns=\\\"http://defaultns.com/\\\"\\n...       xmlns:a=\\\"http://a.com/\\\"\\n...       xmlns:b=\\\"http://b.com/\\\">\\n...   <x>1</x>\\n...   <a:y>2</a:y>\\n...   <b:z>3</b:z>\\n... </root>\\n... \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n>>> xmltodict.parse(xml, process_namespaces=True) == {\\n...     'http://defaultns.com/:root': {\\n...         'http://defaultns.com/:x': '1',\\n...         'http://a.com/:y': '2',\\n...         'http://b.com/:z': '3',\\n...     }\\n... }\\nTrue\\n```\\n\\nIt also lets you collapse certain namespaces to shorthand prefixes, or skip them altogether:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> namespaces = {\\n...     'http://defaultns.com/': None, # skip this namespace\\n...     'http://a.com/': 'ns_a', # collapse \\\"http://a.com/\\\" -> \\\"ns_a\\\"\\n... }\\n>>> xmltodict.parse(xml, process_namespaces=True, namespaces=namespaces) == {\\n...     'root': {\\n...         'x': '1',\\n...         'ns_a:y': '2',\\n...         'http://b.com/:z': '3',\\n...     },\\n... }\\nTrue\\n```\\n\\n## Streaming mode\\n\\n`xmltodict` is very fast ([Expat](http://docs.python.org/library/pyexpat.html)-based) and has a streaming mode with a small memory footprint, suitable for big XML dumps like [Discogs](http://discogs.com/data/) or [Wikipedia](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/):\\n\\n```python\\n>>> def handle_artist(_, artist):\\n...     print(artist['name'])\\n...     return True\\n>>> \\n>>> xmltodict.parse(GzipFile('discogs_artists.xml.gz'),\\n...     item_depth=2, item_callback=handle_artist)\\nA Perfect Circle\\nFantômas\\nKing Crimson\\nChris Potter\\n...\\n```\\n\\nIt can also be used from the command line to pipe objects to a script like this:\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys, marshal\\nwhile True:\\n    _, article = marshal.load(sys.stdin)\\n    print(article['title'])\\n```\\n\\n```sh\\n$ bunzip2 enwiki-pages-articles.xml.bz2 | xmltodict.py 2 | myscript.py\\nAccessibleComputing\\nAnarchism\\nAfghanistanHistory\\nAfghanistanGeography\\nAfghanistanPeople\\nAfghanistanCommunications\\nAutism\\n...\\n```\\n\\nOr just cache the dicts so you don't have to parse that big XML file again. You do this only once:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ bunzip2 enwiki-pages-articles.xml.bz2 | xmltodict.py 2 | gzip > enwiki.dicts.gz\\n```\\n\\nAnd you reuse the dicts with every script that needs them:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ gunzip enwiki.dicts.gz | script1.py\\n$ gunzip enwiki.dicts.gz | script2.py\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Roundtripping\\n\\nYou can also convert in the other direction, using the `unparse()` method:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> mydict = {\\n...

The default value for `attr_prefix` is `@` and the default value for `cdata_key` is `#text`.\\n\\n```python\\n>>> import xmltodict\\n>>> \\n>>> mydict = {\\n...     'text': {\\n...         '@color':'red',\\n...         '@stroke':'2',\\n...

But if a list does have a parent key, for example if a list exists inside another list, it does not have a tag to use and the items are converted to a string as shown in the example below.  To give tags to nested lists, use the `expand_iter` keyword argument to provide a tag as demonstrated below. Note that using `expand_iter` will break roundtripping.\\n\\n```python\\n>>> mydict = {\\n...     \\\"line\\\": {\\n...         \\\"points\\\": [\\n...             [1, 5],\\n...             [2, 6],\\n...         ]\\n...     }\\n... }\\n>>> print(xmltodict.unparse(mydict, pretty=True))\\n<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<line>\\n        <points>[1, 5]</points>\\n        <points>[2, 6]</points>\\n</line>\\n>>> print(xmltodict.unparse(mydict, pretty=True, expand_iter=\\\"coord\\\"))\\n<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<line>\\n        <points>\\n                <coord>1</coord>\\n                <coord>5</coord>\\n        </points>\\n        <points>\\n                <coord>2</coord>\\n                <coord>6</coord>\\n        </points>\\n</line>\\n```\\n\\n## Ok, how do I get it?\\n\\n### Using pypi\\n\\nYou just need to\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pip install xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### Using conda\\n\\nFor installing `xmltodict` using Anaconda/Miniconda (*conda*) from the \\n[conda-forge channel][#xmltodict-conda] all you need to do is:\\n\\n[#xmltodict-conda]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/xmltodict\\n\\n```sh\\n$ conda install -c conda-forge xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### RPM-based distro (Fedora, RHEL, …)\\n\\nThere is an [official Fedora package for xmltodict](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-xmltodict).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo yum install python-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### Arch Linux\\n\\nThere is an [official Arch Linux package for xmltodict](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-xmltodict/).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo pacman -S python-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### Debian-based distro (Debian, Ubuntu, …)\\n\\nThere is an [official Debian package for xmltodict](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-xmltodict).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo apt install python-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### FreeBSD\\n\\nThere is an [official FreeBSD port for xmltodict](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/devel/py-xmltodict/).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pkg install py36-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### openSUSE/SLE (SLE 15, Leap 15, Tumbleweed)\\n\\nThere is an [official openSUSE package for xmltodict](https://software.opensuse.org/package/python-xmltodict).\\n\\n```sh\\n# Python2\\n$ zypper in python2-xmltodict\\n\\n# Python3\\n$ zypper in python3-xmltodict\\n```\\n\",\n",

That way your new feature will also be compatible with the new Notebook v7.\\n\\n## Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook\\n\\nJupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for\\nProject Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of\\nThe Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic\\nrelease containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _IPython notebook_,\\nand language specific code, such as the _IPython kernel for Python_. As\\ncomputing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the\\nlanguage-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the\\ncommunity develop language specific kernels which are found in their own\\ndiscrete repos.\\n\\n- [The Big Split™ announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7)\\n- [Jupyter Ascending blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-ascending-1bf5b362d97e)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can find the installation documentation for the\\n[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\\nThe documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found\\n[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nFor a local installation, make sure you have\\n[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install notebook\\n```\\n\\n## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook\\n\\n### Running in a local installation\\n\\nLaunch with:\\n\\n```bash\\njupyter notebook\\n```\\n\\n### Running in a remote installation\\n\\nYou need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely.

The pyparsing module provides a library of\\nclasses that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in\\nPython code.\\n\\n*[Since first writing this description of pyparsing in late 2003, this\\ntechnique for developing parsers has become more widespread, under the\\nname Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more information on PEGs*\\n`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>`__\\n*.]*\\n\\nHere is a program to parse ``\\\"Hello, World!\\\"`` (or any greeting of the form\\n``\\\"salutation, addressee!\\\"``):\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from pyparsing import Word, alphas\\n    greet = Word(alphas) + \\\",\\\" + Word(alphas) + \\\"!\\\"\\n    hello = \\\"Hello, World!\\\"\\n    print(hello, \\\"->\\\", greet.parse_string(hello))\\n\\nThe program outputs the following::\\n\\n    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']\\n\\nThe Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the\\nself-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operator\\ndefinitions.\\n\\nThe parsed results returned from ``parse_string()`` is a collection of type\\n``ParseResults``, which can be accessed as a\\nnested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.\\n\\nThe pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically\\nvexing when writing text parsers:\\n\\n- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle ``\\\"Hello,World!\\\"``, ``\\\"Hello , World !\\\"``, etc.)\\n- quoted strings\\n- embedded comments\\n\\nThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple CORBA IDL\\nparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-\\nfunction algebraic notation parser, among many others.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n=============\\n\\nThere are many examples in the online docstrings of the classes\\nand methods in pyparsing. You can find them compiled into `online docs <https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. Additional\\ndocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online\\n`GitHub wiki <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki>`__.

Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto\\nfunctionality. Other features include refactoring, code search and finding\\nreferences.\\n\\nJedi has a simple API to work with. There is a reference implementation as a\\n`VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_. Autocompletion in your\\nREPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively and for the CPython REPL you\\ncan install it. Jedi is well tested and bugs should be rare.\\n\\nJedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:\\n\\n- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)\\n- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_)\\n- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)\\n- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])\\n- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)\\n- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though.  [`see\\n  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]\\n- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)\\n- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)\\n- Gedit (gedi_)\\n- wdb_ - Web Debugger\\n- `Eric IDE`_\\n- `IPython 6.0.0+ <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_\\n- `xonsh shell <https://xon.sh/contents.html>`_ has `jedi extension <https://xon.sh/xontribs.html#jedi>`_\\n\\nand many more!\\n\\nThere are a few language servers that use Jedi:\\n\\n- `jedi-language-server <https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server>`_\\n- `python-language-server <https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server>`_ (currently unmaintained)\\n- `python-lsp-server <https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server>`_ (fork from python-language-server)\\n- `anakin-language-server <https://github.com/muffinmad/anakin-language-server>`_\\n\\nHere are some pictures taken from jedi-vim_:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_complete.png\\n\\nCompletion for almost anything:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_function.png\\n\\nDocumentation:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_pydoc.png\\n\\n\\nGet the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_\\n(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).\\n\\nDocs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with enhancements\\nand/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic versioning\\n<https://semver.org/>`_.\\n\\nIf you want to stay **up-to-date** with releases, please **subscribe** to this\\nmailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/jedi-announce. To subscribe you can\\nsimply send an empty email to ``jedi-announce+subscribe@googlegroups.com``.\\n\\nIssues & Questions\\n==================\\n\\nYou can file issues and questions in the `issue tracker\\n<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/>`. Alternatively you can also ask on\\n`Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-jedi>`_ with\\nthe label ``python-jedi``.\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n`Check out the docs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.\\n\\nFeatures and Limitations\\n========================\\n\\nJedi's features are listed here:\\n`Features <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_.\\n\\nYou can run Jedi on Python 3.6+ but it should also\\nunderstand code that is older than those versions. Additionally you should be\\nable to use `Virtualenvs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html#environments>`_\\nvery well.\\n\\nTips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes>`_.\\n\\nAPI\\n---\\n\\nYou can find a comprehensive documentation for the\\n`API here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html>`_.\\n\\nAutocompletion / Goto / Documentation\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are the following commands:\\n\\n- ``jedi.Script.goto``\\n- ``jedi.Script.infer``\\n- ``jedi.Script.help``\\n- ``jedi.Script.complete``\\n- ``jedi.Script.get_references``\\n- ``jedi.Script.get_signatures``\\n- ``jedi.Script.get_context``\\n\\nThe returned objects are very powerful and are really all you might need.\\n\\nAutocompletion in your REPL (IPython, etc.)\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nJedi is a dependency of IPython. Autocompletion in IPython with Jedi is\\ntherefore possible without additional configuration.\\n\\nHere is an `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_ how REPL completion\\ncan look like.\\nFor the ``python`` shell you can enable tab completion in a `REPL\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.\\n\\nStatic Analysis\\n---------------\\n\\nFor a lot of forms of static analysis, you can try to use\\n``jedi.Script(...).get_names``. It will return a list of names that you can\\nthen filter and work with. There is also a way to list the syntax errors in a\\nfile: ``jedi.Script.get_syntax_errors``.\\n\\n\\nRefactoring\\n-----------\\n\\nJedi supports the following refactorings:\\n\\n- ``jedi.Script.inline``\\n- ``jedi.Script.rename``\\n- ``jedi.Script.extract_function``\\n- ``jedi.Script.extract_variable``\\n\\nCode Search\\n-----------\\n\\nThere is support for module search with ``jedi.Script.search``, and project\\nsearch for ``jedi.Project.search``. The way to search is either by providing a\\nname like ``foo`` or by using dotted syntax like ``foo.bar``. Additionally you\\ncan provide the API type like ``class foo.bar.Bar``. There are also the\\nfunctions ``jedi.Script.complete_search`` and ``jedi.Project.complete_search``.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n===========\\n\\nThere's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.\\n\\nTesting\\n=======\\n\\nThe test suite uses ``pytest``::\\n\\n    pip install pytest\\n\\nIf you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 3.8), it is as\\neasy as::\\n\\n    python3.8 -m pytest\\n\\nFor more detailed information visit the `testing documentation\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/testing.html>`_.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n================\\n\\nThanks a lot to all the\\n`contributors <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/acknowledgements.html>`_!\\n\\n\\n.. _jedi-vim: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim\\n.. _youcompleteme: https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe\\n.. _deoplete-jedi: https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi\\n.. _completor.vim: https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim\\n.. _Jedi.el: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi\\n.. _company-mode: https://github.com/syohex/emacs-company-jedi\\n.. _elpy: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy\\n.. _anaconda-mode: https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode\\n.. _ycmd: https://github.com/abingham/emacs-ycmd\\n.. _sublimejedi: https://github.com/srusskih/SublimeJEDI\\n.. _anaconda: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda\\n.. _wdb: https://github.com/Kozea/wdb\\n.. _TextMate: https://github.com/lawrenceakka/python-jedi.tmbundle\\n.. _Kate: https://kate-editor.org\\n.. _Atom: https://atom.io/\\n.. _autocomplete-python-jedi: https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python-jedi\\n.. _GNOME Builder: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder\\n.. _Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/\\n.. _gedi: https://github.com/isamert/gedi\\n.. _Eric IDE: https://eric-ide.python-projects.org\\n\\n\\n.. :changelog:\\n\\nChangelog\\n---------\\n\\nUnreleased\\n++++++++++\\n\\n0.19.2 (2024-11-10)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python 3.13 support\\n\\n0.19.1 (2023-10-02)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python 3.12 support (Thanks Peter!)\\n\\n0.19.0 (2023-07-29)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python 3.11 support\\n- Massive improvements in performance for ``Interpreter`` (e.g. IPython) users.\\n  This especially affects ``pandas`` users with large datasets.\\n- Add ``jedi.settings.allow_unsafe_interpreter_executions`` to make it easier\\n  for IPython users to avoid unsafe executions.\\n\\n0.18.2 (2022-11-21)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added dataclass-equivalent for attrs.define\\n- Find fixtures from Pytest entrypoints; Examples of pytest plugins installed\\n  like this are pytest-django, pytest-sugar and Faker.\\n- Fixed Project.search, when a venv was involved, which is why for example\\n  `:Pyimport django.db` did not work in some cases in jedi-vim.\\n- And many smaller bugfixes\\n\\n0.18.1 (2021-11-17)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Implict namespaces are now a separate types in ``Name().type``\\n- Python 3.10 support\\n- Mostly bugfixes\\n\\n0.18.0 (2020-12-25)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Dropped Python 2 and Python 3.5\\n- Using ``pathlib.Path()`` as an output instead of ``str`` in most places:\\n  - ``Project.path``\\n  - ``Script.path``\\n  - ``Definition.module_path``\\n  - ``Refactoring.get_renames``\\n  - ``Refactoring.get_changed_files``\\n- Functions with ``@property`` now return ``property`` instead of ``function``\\n  in ``Name().type``\\n- Started using annotations\\n- Better support for the walrus operator\\n- Project attributes are now read accessible\\n- Removed all deprecations\\n\\nThis is likely going to be the last minor release before 1.0.\\n\\n0.17.2 (2020-07-17)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added an option to pass environment variables to ``Environment``\\n- ``Project(...).path`` exists now\\n- Support for Python 3.9\\n- A few bugfixes\\n\\nThis will be the last release that supports Python 2 and Python 3.5.\\n``0.18.0`` will be Python 3.6+.\\n\\n0.17.1 (2020-06-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Django ``Model`` meta class support\\n- Django Manager support (completion on Managers/QuerySets)\\n- Added Django Stubs to Jedi, thanks to all contributors of the\\n  `Django Stubs <https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs>`_ project\\n- Added ``SyntaxError.get_message``\\n- Python 3.9 support\\n- Bugfixes (mostly towards Generics)\\n\\n0.17.0 (2020-04-14)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added ``Project`` support. This allows a user to specify which folders Jedi\\n  should work with.\\n- Added support for Refactoring. The following refactorings have been\\n  implemented: ``Script.rename``, ``Script.inline``,\\n  ``Script.extract_variable`` and ``Script.extract_function``.\\n- Added ``Script.get_syntax_errors`` to display syntax errors in the current\\n  script.\\n- Added code search capabilities both for individual files and projects. The\\n  new functions are ``Project.search``, ``Project.complete_search``,\\n  ``Script.search`` and ``Script.complete_search``.\\n- Added ``Script.help`` to make it easier to display a help window to people.\\n  Now returns pydoc information as well for Python keywords/operators.  This\\n  means that on the class keyword it will now return the docstring of Python's\\n  builtin function ``help('class')``.\\n- The API documentation is now way more readable and complete. Check it out\\n  under https://jedi.readthedocs.io. A lot of it has been rewritten.\\n- Removed Python 3.4 support\\n- Many bugfixes\\n\\nThis is likely going to be the last minor version that supports Python 2 and\\nPython3.5. Bugfixes will be provided in 0.17.1+. The next minor/major version\\nwill probably be Jedi 1.0.0.\\n\\n0.16.0 (2020-01-26)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- **Added** ``Script.get_context`` to get information where you currently are.\\n- Completions/type inference of **Pytest fixtures**.\\n- Tensorflow, Numpy and Pandas completions should now be about **4-10x faster**\\n  after the first time they are used.\\n- Dict key completions are working now. e.g. ``d = {1000: 3}; d[10`` will\\n  expand to ``1000``.\\n- Completion for \\\"proxies\\\" works now. These are classes that have a\\n  ``__getattr__(self, name)`` method that does a ``return getattr(x, name)``.\\n  after loading them initially.\\n- Goto on a function/attribute in a class now goes to the definition in its\\n  super class.\\n- Big **Script API Changes**:\\n    - The line and column parameters of ``jedi.Script`` are now deprecated\\n    - ``completions`` deprecated, use ``complete`` instead\\n    - ``goto_assignments`` deprecated, use ``goto`` instead\\n    - ``goto_definitions`` deprecated, use ``infer`` instead\\n    - ``call_signatures`` deprecated, use ``get_signatures`` instead\\n    - ``usages`` deprecated, use ``get_references`` instead\\n    - ``jedi.names`` deprecated, use ``jedi.Script(...).get_names()``\\n- ``BaseName.goto_assignments`` renamed to ``BaseName.goto``\\n- Add follow_imports to ``Name.goto``. Now its signature matches\\n  ``Script.goto``.\\n- **Python 2 support deprecated**. For this release it is best effort. Python 2\\n  has reached the end of its life and now it's just about a smooth transition.\\n  Bugs for Python 2 will not be fixed anymore and a third of the tests are\\n  already skipped.\\n- Removed ``settings.no_completion_duplicates``. It wasn't tested and nobody\\n  was probably using it anyway.\\n- Removed ``settings.use_filesystem_cache`` and\\n  ``settings.additional_dynamic_modules``, they have no usage anymore. Pretty\\n  much nobody was probably using them.\\n\\n0.15.2 (2019-12-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Signatures are now detected a lot better\\n- Add fuzzy completions with ``Script(...).completions(fuzzy=True)``\\n- Files bigger than one MB (about 20kLOC) get cropped to avoid getting\\n  stuck completely.\\n- Many small Bugfixes\\n- A big refactoring around contexts/values\\n\\n0.15.1 (2019-08-13)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Small bugfix and removal of a print statement\\n\\n0.15.0 (2019-08-11)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added file path completions, there's a **new** ``Completion.type`` now:\\n  ``path``. Example: ``'/ho`` -> ``'/home/``\\n- ``*args``/``**kwargs`` resolving. If possible Jedi replaces the parameters\\n  with the actual alternatives.\\n- Better support for enums/dataclasses\\n- When using Interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot of people\\n  have complained about this. Discussion in #1299, #1347.\\n\\nNew APIs:\\n\\n- ``Name.get_signatures() -> List[Signature]``. Signatures are similar to\\n  ``CallSignature``. ``Name.params`` is therefore deprecated.\\n- ``Signature.to_string()`` to format signatures.\\n- ``Signature.params -> List[ParamName]``, ParamName has the\\n  following additional attributes ``infer_default()``, ``infer_annotation()``,\\n  ``to_string()``, and ``kind``.\\n- ``Name.execute() -> List[Name]``, makes it possible to infer\\n  return values of functions.\\n\\n\\n0.14.1 (2019-07-13)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- CallSignature.index should now be working a lot better\\n- A couple of smaller bugfixes\\n\\n0.14.0 (2019-06-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)`` as well as ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)``\\n- Stubs are used now for type inference\\n- Typeshed is used for better type inference\\n- Reworked Name.full_name, should have more correct return values\\n\\n0.13.3 (2019-02-24)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed an issue with embedded Python, see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870\\n\\n0.13.2 (2018-12-15)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed a bug that led to Jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.\\n\\n0.13.1 (2018-10-02)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.\\n\\n0.13.0 (2018-10-02)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- A small release. Some bug fixes.\\n- Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python\\n  foundation.\\n- Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python\\n  process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.\\n- Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.\\n- ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that\\n  changes the previous behavior slightly.\\n\\n0.12.1 (2018-06-30)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing will work\\n  anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug fixes. Unfortunately Jedi\\n  still uses a few internals of parso that make it hard to keep compatibility\\n  over multiple releases. Parso >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.\\n\\n0.12.0 (2018-04-15)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Virtualenv/Environment support\\n- F-String Completion/Goto Support\\n- Cannot crash with segfaults anymore\\n- Cleaned up import logic\\n- Understand async/await and autocomplete it (including async generators)\\n- Better namespace completions\\n- Passing tests for Windows (including CI for Windows)\\n- Remove Python 2.6 support\\n\\n0.11.1 (2017-12-14)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Parso update - the caching layer was broken\\n- Better usages - a lot of internal code was ripped out and improved.\\n\\n0.11.0 (2017-09-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Split Jedi's parser into a separate project called ``parso``.\\n- Avoiding side effects in REPL completion.\\n- Numpy docstring support should be much better.\\n- Moved the `settings.*recursion*` away, they are no longer usable.\\n\\n0.10.2 (2017-04-05)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python Packaging sucks. Some files were not included in 0.10.1.\\n\\n0.10.1 (2017-04-05)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed a few very annoying bugs.\\n- Prepared the parser to be factored out of Jedi.\\n\\n0.10.0 (2017-02-03)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Actual semantic completions for the complete Python syntax.\\n- Basic type inference for ``yield from`` PEP 380.\\n- PEP 484 support (most of the important features of it). Thanks Claude! (@reinhrst)\\n- Added ``get_line_code`` to ``Name`` and ``Completion`` objects.\\n- Completely rewritten the type inference engine.\\n- A new and better parser for (fast) parsing diffs of Python code.\\n\\n0.9.0 (2015-04-10)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's. There is now\\n  an ``InferState.modules`` import cache, which resembles ``sys.modules``.\\n- Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring possible. It will\\n  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an AST would give)\\n  in the future.\\n- With the new parser, the type inference also completely changed. It's now\\n  simpler and more readable.\\n- Completely rewritten REPL completion.\\n- Added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to that\\n  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!\\n- Alpha version of the linter.\\n\\n\\n0.8.1 (2014-07-23)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve\\n  autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.\\n\\n0.8.0 (2014-05-05)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced\\n  drastically. Loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an\\n  import).\\n- REPL completion is starting to become usable.\\n- Various small API changes. Generally this release focuses on stability and\\n  refactoring of internal APIs.\\n- Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct Array\\n  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.\\n\\n0.7.0 (2013-08-09)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Switched from LGPL to MIT license.\\n- Added an Interpreter class to the API to make autocompletion in REPL\\n  possible.\\n- Added autocompletion support for namespace packages.\\n- Add sith.py, a new random testing method.\\n\\n0.6.0 (2013-05-14)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Much faster parser with builtin part caching.\\n- A test suite, thanks @tkf.\\n\\n0.5 versions (2012)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Initial development.\\n\",\n",

This function returns a context manager\\nthat calls the given handler for any exceptions matching the sole argument.\\n\\nThe argument to ``catch()`` must be a dict (or any ``Mapping``) where each key is either\\nan exception class or an iterable of exception classes. Each value must be a callable\\nthat takes a single positional argument. The handler will be called at most once, with\\nan exception group as an argument which will contain all the exceptions that are any\\nof the given types, or their subclasses. The exception group may contain nested groups\\ncontaining more matching exceptions.\\n\\nThus, the following Python 3.11+ code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    try:\\n        ...\\n    except* (ValueError, KeyError) as excgroup:\\n        for exc in excgroup.exceptions:\\n            print('Caught exception:', type(exc))\\n    except* RuntimeError:\\n        print('Caught runtime error')\\n\\nwould be written with this backport like this:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from exceptiongroup import BaseExceptionGroup, catch\\n\\n    def value_key_err_handler(excgroup: BaseExceptionGroup) -> None:\\n        for exc in excgroup.exceptions:\\n            print('Caught exception:', type(exc))\\n\\n    def runtime_err_handler(exc: BaseExceptionGroup) -> None:\\n        print('Caught runtime error')\\n\\n    with catch({\\n        (ValueError, KeyError): value_key_err_handler,\\n        RuntimeError: runtime_err_handler\\n    }):\\n        ...\\n\\n**NOTE**: Just like with ``except*``, you cannot handle ``BaseExceptionGroup`` or\\n``ExceptionGroup`` with ``catch()``.\\n\\nSuppressing exceptions\\n======================\\n\\nThis library contains a backport of the ``contextlib.suppress()`` context manager from\\nPython 3.12.1. It allows you to selectively ignore certain exceptions, even when they're\\ninside exception groups:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from exceptiongroup import suppress\\n\\n    with suppress(RuntimeError):\\n        raise ExceptionGroup(\\\"\\\", [RuntimeError(\\\"boo\\\")])\\n\\nNotes on monkey patching\\n========================\\n\\nTo make exception groups render properly when an unhandled exception group is being\\nprinted out, this package does two things when it is imported on any Python version\\nearlier than 3.11:\\n\\n#. The  ``traceback.TracebackException`` class is monkey patched to store extra\\n   information about exception groups (in ``__init__()``) and properly format them (in\\n   ``format()``)\\n#. An exception hook is installed at ``sys.excepthook``, provided that no other hook is\\n   already present. This hook causes the exception to be formatted using\\n   ``traceback.TracebackException`` rather than the built-in rendered.\\n\\nIf ``sys.exceptionhook`` is found to be set to something else than the default when\\n``exceptiongroup`` is imported, no monkeypatching is done at all.\\n\\nTo prevent the exception hook and patches from being installed, set the environment\\nvariable ``EXCEPTIONGROUP_NO_PATCH`` to ``1``.\\n\\nFormatting exception groups\\n---------------------------\\n\\nNormally, the monkey patching applied by this library on import will cause exception\\ngroups to be printed properly in tracebacks. But in cases when the monkey patching is\\nblocked by a third party exception hook, or monkey patching is explicitly disabled,\\nyou can still manually format exceptions using the special versions of the ``traceback``\\nfunctions, like ``format_exception()``, listed at the top of this page. They work just\\nlike their counterparts in the ``traceback`` module, except that they use a separately\\npatched subclass of ``TracebackException`` to perform the rendering.\\n\\nParticularly in cases where a library installs its own exception hook, it is recommended\\nto use these special versions to do the actual formatting of exceptions/tracebacks.\\n\\n.. _PEP 654: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/\\n\\n\",\n",

Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\\n\\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can.\\n\\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\\n\\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair Unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\\n\\n## 🍰 How\\n\\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\\n\\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\\n\\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess (aka. defining noise in rendered text).\\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\\n improve or rewrite it.\\n\\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\\n\\n## ⚡ Known limitations\\n\\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\\n\\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\\n\\n**If you are running:**\\n\\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\\n\\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\\n\\n## 👤 Contributing\\n\\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\\n\\n## 📝 License\\n\\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\\n\\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\\n\\n## 💼 For Enterprise\\n\\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\\nSubscription][1].

Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\\n\\n`typing_extensions` uses\\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The\\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\\nTherefore, it's safe to depend\\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,\\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\\n\\n## Included items\\n\\nSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\\ncomplete listing of module contents.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\\n\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"PySocks\\n=======\\n\\nPySocks lets you send traffic through SOCKS and HTTP proxy servers. It is a modern fork of [SocksiPy](http://socksipy.sourceforge.net/) with bug fixes and extra features.\\n\\nActs as a drop-in replacement to the socket module. Seamlessly configure SOCKS proxies for any socket object by calling `socket_object.set_proxy()`.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nFeatures\\n========\\n\\n* SOCKS proxy client for Python 2.7 and 3.4+\\n* TCP supported\\n* UDP mostly supported (issues may occur in some edge cases)\\n* HTTP proxy client included but not supported or recommended (you should use urllib2's or requests' own HTTP proxy interface)\\n* urllib2 handler included. `pip install` / `setup.py install` will automatically install the `sockshandler` module.\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n    pip install PySocks\\n\\nOr download the tarball / `git clone` and...\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\nThese will install both the `socks` and `sockshandler` modules.\\n\\nAlternatively, include just `socks.py` in your project.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n*Warning:* PySocks/SocksiPy only supports HTTP proxies that use CONNECT tunneling. Certain HTTP proxies may not work with this library. If you wish to use HTTP (not SOCKS) proxies, it is recommended that you rely on your HTTP client's native proxy support (`proxies` dict for `requests`, or `urllib2.ProxyHandler` for `urllib2`) instead.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsage\\n=====\\n\\n## socks.socksocket ##\\n\\n    import socks\\n\\n    s = socks.socksocket() # Same API as socket.socket in the standard lib\\n\\n    s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"localhost\\\") # SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 use port 1080 by default\\n    # Or\\n    s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS4, \\\"localhost\\\", 4444)\\n    # Or\\n    s.set_proxy(socks.HTTP, \\\"5.5.5.5\\\", 8888)\\n\\n    # Can be treated identical to a regular socket object\\n    s.connect((\\\"www.somesite.com\\\", 80))\\n    s.sendall(\\\"GET / HTTP/1.1 ...\\\")\\n    print s.recv(4096)\\n\\n## Monkeypatching ##\\n\\nTo monkeypatch the entire standard library with a single default proxy:\\n\\n    import urllib2\\n    import socket\\n    import socks\\n\\n    socks.set_default_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"localhost\\\")\\n    socket.socket = socks.socksocket\\n\\n    urllib2.urlopen(\\\"http://www.somesite.com/\\\") # All requests will pass through the SOCKS proxy\\n\\nNote that monkeypatching may not work for all standard modules or for all third party modules, and generally isn't recommended. Monkeypatching is usually an anti-pattern in Python.\\n\\n## urllib2 Handler ##\\n\\nExample use case with the `sockshandler` urllib2 handler. Note that you must import both `socks` and `sockshandler`, as the handler is its own module separate from PySocks. The module is included in the PyPI package.\\n\\n    import urllib2\\n    import socks\\n    from sockshandler import SocksiPyHandler\\n\\n    opener = urllib2.build_opener(SocksiPyHandler(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"127.0.0.1\\\", 9050))\\n    print opener.open(\\\"http://www.somesite.com/\\\") # All requests made by the opener will pass through the SOCKS proxy\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nOriginal SocksiPy README attached below, amended to reflect API changes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nSocksiPy\\n\\nA Python SOCKS module.\\n\\n(C) 2006 Dan-Haim. All rights reserved.\\n\\nSee LICENSE file for details.\\n\\n\\n*WHAT IS A SOCKS PROXY?*\\n\\nA SOCKS proxy is a proxy server at the TCP level. In other words, it acts as\\na tunnel, relaying all traffic going through it without modifying it.\\nSOCKS proxies can be used to relay traffic using any network protocol that\\nuses TCP.\\n\\n*WHAT IS SOCKSIPY?*\\n\\nThis Python module allows you to create TCP connections through a SOCKS\\nproxy without any special effort.\\nIt also supports relaying UDP packets with a SOCKS5 proxy.\\n\\n*PROXY COMPATIBILITY*\\n\\nSocksiPy is compatible with three different types of proxies:\\n\\n1. SOCKS Version 4 (SOCKS4), including the SOCKS4a extension.\\n2. SOCKS Version 5 (SOCKS5).\\n3. HTTP Proxies which support tunneling using the CONNECT method.\\n\\n*SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS*\\n\\nBeing written in Python, SocksiPy can run on any platform that has a Python\\ninterpreter and TCP/IP support.\\nThis module has been tested with Python 2.3 and should work with greater versions\\njust as well.\\n\\n\\nINSTALLATION\\n-------------\\n\\nSimply copy the file \\\"socks.py\\\" to your Python's `lib/site-packages` directory,\\nand you're ready to go. [Editor's note: it is better to use `python setup.py install` for PySocks]\\n\\n\\nUSAGE\\n------\\n\\nFirst load the socks module with the command:\\n\\n    >>> import socks\\n    >>>\\n\\nThe socks module provides a class called `socksocket`, which is the base to all of the module's functionality.\\n\\nThe `socksocket` object has the same initialization parameters as the normal socket\\nobject to ensure maximal compatibility, however it should be noted that `socksocket` will only function with family being `AF_INET` and\\ntype being either `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`.\\nGenerally, it is best to initialize the `socksocket` object with no parameters\\n\\n    >>> s = socks.socksocket()\\n    >>>\\n\\nThe `socksocket` object has an interface which is very similiar to socket's (in fact\\nthe `socksocket` class is derived from socket) with a few extra methods.\\nTo select the proxy server you would like to use, use the `set_proxy` method, whose\\nsyntax is:\\n\\n    set_proxy(proxy_type, addr[, port[, rdns[, username[, password]]]])\\n\\nExplanation of the parameters:\\n\\n`proxy_type` - The type of the proxy server. This can be one of three possible\\nchoices: `PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS4`, `PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5` and `PROXY_TYPE_HTTP` for SOCKS4,\\nSOCKS5 and HTTP servers respectively. `SOCKS4`, `SOCKS5`, and `HTTP` are all aliases, respectively.\\n\\n`addr` - The IP address or DNS name of the proxy server.\\n\\n`port` - The port of the proxy server. Defaults to 1080 for socks and 8080 for http.\\n\\n`rdns` - This is a boolean flag than modifies the behavior regarding DNS resolving.\\nIf it is set to True, DNS resolving will be preformed remotely, on the server.\\nIf it is set to False, DNS resolving will be preformed locally. Please note that\\nsetting this to True with SOCKS4 servers actually use an extension to the protocol,\\ncalled SOCKS4a, which may not be supported on all servers (SOCKS5 and http servers\\nalways support DNS). The default is True.\\n\\n`username` - For SOCKS5 servers, this allows simple username / password authentication\\nwith the server. For SOCKS4 servers, this parameter will be sent as the userid.\\nThis parameter is ignored if an HTTP server is being used. If it is not provided,\\nauthentication will not be used (servers may accept unauthenticated requests).\\n\\n`password` - This parameter is valid only for SOCKS5 servers and specifies the\\nrespective password for the username provided.\\n\\nExample of usage:\\n\\n    >>> s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"socks.example.com\\\") # uses default port 1080\\n    >>> s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS4, \\\"socks.test.com\\\", 1081)\\n\\nAfter the set_proxy method has been called, simply call the connect method with the\\ntraditional parameters to establish a connection through the proxy:\\n\\n    >>> s.connect((\\\"www.sourceforge.net\\\", 80))\\n    >>>\\n\\nConnection will take a bit longer to allow negotiation with the proxy server.\\nPlease note that calling connect without calling `set_proxy` earlier will connect\\nwithout a proxy (just like a regular socket).\\n\\nErrors: Any errors in the connection process will trigger exceptions. The exception\\nmay either be generated by the underlying socket layer or may be custom module\\nexceptions, whose details follow:\\n\\nclass `ProxyError` - This is a base exception class. It is not raised directly but\\nrather all other exception classes raised by this module are derived from it.\\nThis allows an easy way to catch all proxy-related errors. It descends from `IOError`.\\n\\nAll `ProxyError` exceptions have an attribute `socket_err`, which will contain either a\\ncaught `socket.error` exception, or `None` if there wasn't any.\\n\\nclass `GeneralProxyError` - When thrown, it indicates a problem which does not fall\\ninto another category.\\n\\n* `Sent invalid data` - This error means that unexpected data has been received from\\nthe server. The most common reason is that the server specified as the proxy is\\nnot really a SOCKS4/SOCKS5/HTTP proxy, or maybe the proxy type specified is wrong.\\n\\n* `Connection closed unexpectedly` - The proxy server unexpectedly closed the connection.\\nThis may indicate that the proxy server is experiencing network or software problems.\\n\\n* `Bad proxy type` - This will be raised if the type of the proxy supplied to the\\nset_proxy function was not one of `SOCKS4`/`SOCKS5`/`HTTP`.\\n\\n* `Bad input` - This will be raised if the `connect()` method is called with bad input\\nparameters.\\n\\nclass `SOCKS5AuthError` - This indicates that the connection through a SOCKS5 server\\nfailed due to an authentication problem.\\n\\n* `Authentication is required` - This will happen if you use a SOCKS5 server which\\nrequires authentication without providing a username / password at all.\\n\\n* `All offered authentication methods were rejected` - This will happen if the proxy\\nrequires a special authentication method which is not supported by this module.\\n\\n* `Unknown username or invalid password` - Self descriptive.\\n\\nclass `SOCKS5Error` - This will be raised for SOCKS5 errors which are not related to\\nauthentication.\\nThe parameter is a tuple containing a code, as given by the server,\\nand a description of the\\nerror. The possible errors, according to the RFC, are:\\n\\n* `0x01` - General SOCKS server failure - If for any reason the proxy server is unable to\\nfulfill your request (internal server error).\\n* `0x02` - connection not allowed by ruleset - If the address you're trying to connect to\\nis blacklisted on the server or requires authentication.\\n* `0x03` - Network unreachable - The target could not be contacted. A router on the network\\nhad replied with a destination net unreachable error.\\n* `0x04` - Host unreachable - The target could not be contacted. A router on the network\\nhad replied with a destination host unreachable error.\\n* `0x05` - Connection refused - The target server has actively refused the connection\\n(the requested port is closed).\\n* `0x06` - TTL expired - The TTL value of the SYN packet from the proxy to the target server\\nhas expired. This usually means that there are network problems causing the packet\\nto be caught in a router-to-router \\\"ping-pong\\\".\\n* `0x07` - Command not supported - For instance if the server does not support UDP.\\n* `0x08` - Address type not supported - The client has provided an invalid address type.\\nWhen using this module, this error should not occur.\\n\\nclass `SOCKS4Error` - This will be raised for SOCKS4 errors. The parameter is a tuple\\ncontaining a code and a description of the error, as given by the server. The\\npossible error, according to the specification are:\\n\\n* `0x5B` - Request rejected or failed - Will be raised in the event of an failure for any\\nreason other then the two mentioned next.\\n* `0x5C` - request rejected because SOCKS server cannot connect to identd on the client -\\nThe Socks server had tried an ident lookup on your computer and has failed. In this\\ncase you should run an identd server and/or configure your firewall to allow incoming\\nconnections to local port 113 from the remote server.\\n* `0x5D` - request rejected because the client program and identd report different user-ids -\\nThe Socks server had performed an ident lookup on your computer and has received a\\ndifferent userid than the one you have provided. Change your userid (through the\\nusername parameter of the set_proxy method) to match and try again.\\n\\nclass `HTTPError` - This will be raised for HTTP errors. The message will contain\\nthe HTTP status code and provided error message.\\n\\nAfter establishing the connection, the object behaves like a standard socket.\\n\\nMethods like `makefile()` and `settimeout()` should behave just like regular sockets.\\nCall the `close()` method to close the connection.\\n\\nIn addition to the `socksocket` class, an additional function worth mentioning is the\\n`set_default_proxy` function. The parameters are the same as the `set_proxy` method.\\nThis function will set default proxy settings for newly created `socksocket` objects,\\nin which the proxy settings haven't been changed via the `set_proxy` method.\\nThis is quite useful if you wish to force 3rd party modules to use a SOCKS proxy,\\nby overriding the socket object.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    >>> socks.set_default_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"socks.example.com\\\")\\n    >>> socket.socket = socks.socksocket\\n    >>> urllib.urlopen(\\\"http://www.sourceforge.net/\\\")\\n\\n\\nPROBLEMS\\n---------\\n\\nPlease open a GitHub issue at https://github.com/Anorov/PySocks\\n\",\n",

The limited instructions below for setting up a development environment are for your convenience.\\n\\n## Coding\\n\\nYou'll need Python and `pip` on the search path. Clone the Jupyter Client git repository to your computer, for example in `/my/project/jupyter_client`\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /my/projects/\\ngit clone git@github.com:jupyter/jupyter_client.git\\n```\\n\\nNow create an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)\\nand download the dependencies of code and test suite by executing:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /my/projects/jupyter_client/\\npip install -e \\\".[test]\\\"\\npytest\\n```\\n\\nThe last command runs the test suite to verify the setup. During development, you can pass filenames to `pytest`, and it will execute only those tests.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe documentation of Jupyter Client is generated from the files in `docs/` using Sphinx. Instructions for setting up Sphinx with a selection of optional modules are in the [Documentation Guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/docs-contributions/index.html). You'll also need the `make` command.\\nFor a minimal Sphinx installation to process the Jupyter Client docs, execute:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install \\\".[doc]\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe following commands build the documentation in HTML format and check for broken links:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\\nmake html linkcheck\\n```\\n\\nPoint your browser to the following URL to access the generated documentation:\\n\\n_file:///my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\\\\_build/html/index.html_\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n`jupyter-client` has adopted automatic code formatting so you shouldn't\\nneed to worry too much about your code style.\\nAs long as your code is valid,\\nthe pre-commit hook should take care of how it should look.\\nYou can invoke the pre-commit hook by hand at any time with:\\n\\n```bash\\npre-commit run\\n```\\n\\nwhich should run any autoformatting on your code\\nand tell you about any errors it couldn't fix automatically.\\nYou may also install [black integration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html)\\ninto your text editor to format code automatically.\\n\\nIf you have already committed files before setting up the pre-commit\\nhook with `pre-commit install`, you can fix everything up using\\n`pre-commit run --all-files`. You need to make the fixing commit\\nyourself after that.\\n\\nSome of the hooks only run on CI by default, but you can invoke them by\\nrunning with the `--hook-stage manual` argument.\\n\\n## About the Jupyter Development Team\\n\\nThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.\\nThis includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright\\nover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these\\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories.

Start of user-guide\\n\\nThe ``asttokens`` module annotates Python abstract syntax trees (ASTs) with the positions of tokens\\nand text in the source code that generated them.\\n\\nIt makes it possible for tools that work with logical AST nodes to find the particular text that\\nresulted in those nodes, for example for automated refactoring or highlighting.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\nasttokens is available on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asttokens/::\\n\\n    pip install asttokens\\n\\nThe code is on GitHub: https://github.com/gristlabs/asttokens.\\n\\nThe API Reference is here: http://asttokens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-index.html.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nASTTokens can annotate both trees built by `ast <https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html>`_,\\nAND those built by `astroid <https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid>`_.\\n\\nHere's an example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    import asttokens, ast\\n    source = \\\"Robot('blue').walk(steps=10*n)\\\"\\n    atok = asttokens.ASTTokens(source, parse=True)\\n\\nOnce the tree has been marked, nodes get ``.first_token``, ``.last_token`` attributes, and\\nthe ``ASTTokens`` object offers helpful methods:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    attr_node = next(n for n in ast.walk(atok.tree) if isinstance(n, ast.Attribute))\\n    print(atok.get_text(attr_node))\\n    start, end = attr_node.last_token.startpos, attr_node.last_token.endpos\\n    print(atok.text[:start] + 'RUN' + atok.text[end:])\\n\\nWhich produces this output:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    Robot('blue').walk\\n    Robot('blue').RUN(steps=10*n)\\n\\nThe ``ASTTokens`` object also offers methods to walk and search the list of tokens that make up\\nthe code (or a particular AST node), which is more useful and powerful than dealing with the text\\ndirectly.\\n\\n\\nContribute\\n----------\\n\\nTo contribute:\\n\\n1. Fork this repository, and clone your fork.\\n2. Install the package with test dependencies (ideally in a virtualenv) with::\\n\\n    pip install -e '.[test]'\\n\\n3. Run tests in your current interpreter with the command ``pytest`` or ``python -m pytest``.\\n4. Run tests across all supported interpreters with the ``tox`` command. You will need to have the interpreters installed separately. We recommend ``pyenv`` for that. Use ``tox -p auto`` to run the tests in parallel.\\n5. By default certain tests which take a very long time to run are skipped, but they are run in CI.\\n   These are marked using the ``pytest`` marker ``slow`` and can be run on their own with ``pytest -m slow`` or as part of the full suite with ``pytest -m ''``.\\n\",\n",

For example,\\n    `IDLE <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/191#issuecomment-230168030>`__,\\n    `ConEmu <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/254>`__ and\\n    `PyCharm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/203>`__ (also\\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/208>`__,\\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/307>`__, and\\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/454#issuecomment-335416815>`__)\\n    lack full support.\\n  * Windows: additionally may require the Python module ``colorama``\\n    to ensure nested bars stay within their respective lines.\\n\\n- Unicode:\\n\\n  * Environments which report that they support unicode will have solid smooth\\n    progressbars. The fallback is an ``ascii``-only bar.\\n  * Windows consoles often only partially support unicode and thus\\n    `often require explicit ascii=True <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/454#issuecomment-335416815>`__\\n    (also `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/499>`__). This is due to\\n    either normal-width unicode characters being incorrectly displayed as\\n    \\\"wide\\\", or some unicode characters not rendering.\\n\\n- Wrapping generators:\\n\\n  * Generator wrapper functions tend to hide the length of iterables.\\n    ``tqdm`` does not.\\n  * Replace ``tqdm(enumerate(...))`` with ``enumerate(tqdm(...))`` or\\n    ``tqdm(enumerate(x), total=len(x), ...)``.\\n    The same applies to ``numpy.ndenumerate``.\\n  * Replace ``tqdm(zip(a, b))`` with ``zip(tqdm(a), b)`` or even\\n    ``zip(tqdm(a), tqdm(b))``.\\n  * The same applies to ``itertools``.\\n  * Some useful convenience functions can be found under ``tqdm.contrib``.\\n\\n- `No intermediate output in docker-compose <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/771>`__:\\n  use ``docker-compose run`` instead of ``docker-compose up`` and ``tty: true``.\\n\\n- Overriding defaults via environment variables:\\n  e.g. in CI/cloud jobs, ``export TQDM_MININTERVAL=5`` to avoid log spam.\\n  This override logic is handled by the ``tqdm.utils.envwrap`` decorator\\n  (useful independent of ``tqdm``).\\n\\nIf you come across any other difficulties, browse and file |GitHub-Issues|.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\n|Py-Versions| |README-Hits| (Since 19 May 2016)\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    class tqdm():\\n      \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n      Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly\\n      like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating\\n      progressbar every time a value is requested.\\n      \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n      @envwrap(\\\"TQDM_\\\")  # override defaults via env vars\\n      def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,\\n                   file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1,\\n                   maxinterval=10.0, miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False,\\n                   unit='it', unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False,\\n                   smoothing=0.3, bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None,\\n                   postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, write_bytes=False,\\n                   lock_args=None, nrows=None, colour=None, delay=0):\\n\\nParameters\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n* iterable  : iterable, optional  \\n    Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.\\n    Leave blank to manually manage the updates.\\n* desc  : str, optional  \\n    Prefix for the progressbar.\\n* total  : int or float, optional  \\n    The number of expected iterations.

Use ``auto`` instead of ``autonotebook`` to suppress\\nthis warning.\\n\\nNote that notebooks will display the bar in the cell where it was created.\\nThis may be a different cell from the one where it is used.\\nIf this is not desired, either\\n\\n- delay the creation of the bar to the cell where it must be displayed, or\\n- create the bar with ``display=False``, and in a later cell call\\n  ``display(bar.container)``:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\\n    pbar = tqdm(..., display=False)\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    # different cell\\n    display(pbar.container)\\n\\nThe ``keras`` callback has a ``display()`` method which can be used likewise:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.keras import TqdmCallback\\n    cbk = TqdmCallback(display=False)\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    # different cell\\n    cbk.display()\\n    model.fit(..., verbose=0, callbacks=[cbk])\\n\\nAnother possibility is to have a single bar (near the top of the notebook)\\nwhich is constantly re-used (using ``reset()`` rather than ``close()``).\\nFor this reason, the notebook version (unlike the CLI version) does not\\nautomatically call ``close()`` upon ``Exception``.\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\\n    pbar = tqdm()\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    # different cell\\n    iterable = range(100)\\n    pbar.reset(total=len(iterable))  # initialise with new `total`\\n    for i in iterable:\\n        pbar.update()\\n    pbar.refresh()  # force print final status but don't `close()`\\n\\nCustom Integration\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo change the default arguments (such as making ``dynamic_ncols=True``),\\nsimply use built-in Python magic:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from functools import partial\\n    from tqdm import tqdm as std_tqdm\\n    tqdm = partial(std_tqdm, dynamic_ncols=True)\\n\\nFor further customisation,\\n``tqdm`` may be inherited from to create custom callbacks (as with the\\n``TqdmUpTo`` example `above <#hooks-and-callbacks>`__) or for custom frontends\\n(e.g. GUIs such as notebook or plotting packages). In the latter case:\\n\\n1. ``def __init__()`` to call ``super().__init__(..., gui=True)`` to disable\\n   terminal ``status_printer`` creation.\\n2. Redefine: ``close()``, ``clear()``, ``display()``.\\n\\nConsider overloading ``display()`` to use e.g.\\n``self.frontend(**self.format_dict)`` instead of ``self.sp(repr(self))``.\\n\\nSome submodule examples of inheritance:\\n\\n- `tqdm/notebook.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/notebook.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/gui.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/gui.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/tk.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/tk.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/contrib/slack.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/slack.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/contrib/discord.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/discord.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/contrib/telegram.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/telegram.py>`__\\n\\nDynamic Monitor/Meter\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYou can use a ``tqdm`` as a meter which is not monotonically increasing.\\nThis could be because ``n`` decreases (e.g. a CPU usage monitor) or ``total``\\nchanges.\\n\\nOne example would be recursively searching for files. The ``total`` is the\\nnumber of objects found so far, while ``n`` is the number of those objects which\\nare files (rather than folders):\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm import tqdm\\n    import os.path\\n\\n    def find_files_recursively(path, show_progress=True):\\n        files = []\\n        # total=1 assumes `path` is a file\\n        t = tqdm(total=1, unit=\\\"file\\\", disable=not show_progress)\\n        if not os.path.exists(path):\\n            raise IOError(\\\"Cannot find:\\\" + path)\\n\\n        def append_found_file(f):\\n            files.append(f)\\n            t.update()\\n\\n        def list_found_dir(path):\\n            \\\"\\\"\\\"returns os.listdir(path) assuming os.path.isdir(path)\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n            listing = os.listdir(path)\\n            # subtract 1 since a \\\"file\\\" we found was actually this directory\\n            t.total += len(listing) - 1\\n            # fancy way to give info without forcing a refresh\\n            t.set_postfix(dir=path[-10:], refresh=False)\\n            t.update(0)  # may trigger a refresh\\n            return listing\\n\\n        def recursively_search(path):\\n            if os.path.isdir(path):\\n                for f in list_found_dir(path):\\n                    recursively_search(os.path.join(path, f))\\n            else:\\n                append_found_file(path)\\n\\n        recursively_search(path)\\n        t.set_postfix(dir=path)\\n        t.close()\\n        return files\\n\\nUsing ``update(0)`` is a handy way to let ``tqdm`` decide when to trigger a\\ndisplay refresh to avoid console spamming.\\n\\nWriting messages\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThis is a work in progress (see\\n`#737 <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/737>`__).\\n\\nSince ``tqdm`` uses a simple printing mechanism to display progress bars,\\nyou should not write any message in the terminal using ``print()`` while\\na progressbar is open.\\n\\nTo write messages in the terminal without any collision with ``tqdm`` bar\\ndisplay, a ``.write()`` method is provided:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.auto import tqdm, trange\\n    from time import sleep\\n\\n    bar = trange(10)\\n    for i in bar:\\n        # Print using tqdm class method .write()\\n        sleep(0.1)\\n        if not (i % 3):\\n            tqdm.write(\\\"Done task %i\\\" % i)\\n        # Can also use bar.write()\\n\\nBy default, this will print to standard output ``sys.stdout``. but you can\\nspecify any file-like object using the ``file`` argument. For example, this\\ncan be used to redirect the messages writing to a log file or class.\\n\\nRedirecting writing\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIf using a library that can print messages to the console, editing the library\\nby  replacing ``print()`` with ``tqdm.write()`` may not be desirable.\\nIn that case, redirecting ``sys.stdout`` to ``tqdm.write()`` is an option.\\n\\nTo redirect ``sys.stdout``, create a file-like class that will write\\nany input string to ``tqdm.write()``, and supply the arguments\\n``file=sys.stdout, dynamic_ncols=True``.\\n\\nA reusable canonical example is given below:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from time import sleep\\n    import contextlib\\n    import sys\\n    from tqdm import tqdm\\n    from tqdm.contrib import DummyTqdmFile\\n\\n\\n    @contextlib.contextmanager\\n    def std_out_err_redirect_tqdm():\\n        orig_out_err = sys.stdout, sys.stderr\\n        try:\\n            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = map(DummyTqdmFile, orig_out_err)\\n            yield orig_out_err[0]\\n        # Relay exceptions\\n        except Exception as exc:\\n            raise exc\\n        # Always restore sys.stdout/err if necessary\\n        finally:\\n            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = orig_out_err\\n\\n    def some_fun(i):\\n        print(\\\"Fee, fi, fo,\\\".split()[i])\\n\\n    # Redirect stdout to tqdm.write() (don't forget the `as save_stdout`)\\n    with std_out_err_redirect_tqdm() as orig_stdout:\\n        # tqdm needs the original stdout\\n        # and dynamic_ncols=True to autodetect console width\\n        for i in tqdm(range(3), file=orig_stdout, dynamic_ncols=True):\\n            sleep(.5)\\n            some_fun(i)\\n\\n    # After the `with`, printing is restored\\n    print(\\\"Done!\\\")\\n\\nRedirecting ``logging``\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSimilar to ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` as detailed above, console ``logging``\\nmay also be redirected to ``tqdm.write()``.\\n\\nWarning: if also redirecting ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr``, make sure to\\nredirect ``logging`` first if needed.\\n\\nHelper methods are available in ``tqdm.contrib.logging``. For example:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    import logging\\n    from tqdm import trange\\n    from tqdm.contrib.logging import logging_redirect_tqdm\\n\\n    LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n\\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\\n        with logging_redirect_tqdm():\\n            for i in trange(9):\\n                if i == 4:\\n                    LOG.info(\\\"console logging redirected to `tqdm.write()`\\\")\\n        # logging restored\\n\\nMonitoring thread, intervals and miniters\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n``tqdm`` implements a few tricks to increase efficiency and reduce overhead.\\n\\n- Avoid unnecessary frequent bar refreshing: ``mininterval`` defines how long\\n  to wait between each refresh. ``tqdm`` always gets updated in the background,\\n  but it will display only every ``mininterval``.\\n- Reduce number of calls to check system clock/time.\\n- ``mininterval`` is more intuitive to configure than ``miniters``.\\n  A clever adjustment system ``dynamic_miniters`` will automatically adjust\\n  ``miniters`` to the amount of iterations that fit into time ``mininterval``.\\n  Essentially, ``tqdm`` will check if it's time to print without actually\\n  checking time. This behaviour can be still be bypassed by manually setting\\n  ``miniters``.\\n\\nHowever, consider a case with a combination of fast and slow iterations.\\nAfter a few fast iterations, ``dynamic_miniters`` will set ``miniters`` to a\\nlarge number. When iteration rate subsequently slows, ``miniters`` will\\nremain large and thus reduce display update frequency. To address this:\\n\\n- ``maxinterval`` defines the maximum time between display refreshes.\\n  A concurrent monitoring thread checks for overdue updates and forces one\\n  where necessary.\\n\\nThe monitoring thread should not have a noticeable overhead, and guarantees\\nupdates at least every 10 seconds by default.\\nThis value can be directly changed by setting the ``monitor_interval`` of\\nany ``tqdm`` instance (i.e. ``t = tqdm.tqdm(...); t.monitor_interval = 2``).\\nThe monitor thread may be disabled application-wide by setting\\n``tqdm.tqdm.monitor_interval = 0`` before instantiation of any ``tqdm`` bar.\\n\\n\\nMerch\\n-----\\n\\nYou can buy `tqdm branded merch <https://tqdm.github.io/merch>`__ now!\\n\\nContributions\\n-------------\\n\\n|GitHub-Commits|

      "            \"description\": \"# pyjson5\\n\\nA Python implementation of the JSON5 data format.\\n\\n[JSON5](https://json5.org) extends the\\n[JSON](http://www.json.org) data interchange format to make it\\nslightly more usable as a configuration language:\\n\\n* JavaScript-style comments (both single and multi-line) are legal.\\n\\n* Object keys may be unquoted if they are legal ECMAScript identifiers\\n\\n* Objects and arrays may end with trailing commas.\\n\\n* Strings can be single-quoted, and multi-line string literals are allowed.\\n\\nThere are a few other more minor extensions to JSON; see the above page for\\nthe full details.\\n\\nThis project implements a reader and writer implementation for Python;\\nwhere possible, it mirrors the\\n[standard Python JSON API](https://docs.python.org/library/json.html)\\npackage for ease of use.\\n\\nThere is one notable difference from the JSON api: the `load()` and\\n`loads()` methods support optionally checking for (and rejecting) duplicate\\nobject keys; pass `allow_duplicate_keys=False` to do so (duplicates are\\nallowed by default).\\n\\nThis is an early release. It has been reasonably well-tested, but it is\\n**SLOW**. It can be 1000-6000x slower than the C-optimized JSON module,\\nand is 200x slower (or more) than the pure Python JSON module.\\n\\n**Please Note:** This library only handles JSON5 documents, it does not\\nallow you to read arbitrary JavaScript. For example, bare integers can\\nbe legal object keys in JavaScript, but they aren't in JSON5.\\n\\n## Known issues\\n\\n* Did I mention that it is **SLOW**?\\n\\n* The implementation follows Python3's `json` implementation where\\n  possible. This means that the `encoding` method to `dump()` is\\n  ignored, and unicode strings are always returned.\\n\\n* The `cls` keyword argument that `json.load()`/`json.loads()` accepts\\n  to specify a custom subclass of ``JSONDecoder`` is not and will not be\\n  supported, because this implementation uses a completely different\\n  approach to parsing strings and doesn't have anything like the\\n  `JSONDecoder` class.\\n\\n* The `cls` keyword argument that `json.dump()`/`json.dumps()` accepts\\n  is also not supported, for consistency with `json5.load()`. The `default`\\n  keyword *is* supported, though, and might be able to serve as a\\n  workaround.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n`json5` have no runtime dependencies and it is supported on Python version 3.8\\nor later. However, in order to develop and build the package you need a\\nbunch of extra tools and the latest versions of those tools may require 3.9\\nor later. You can install the extra environment on 3.8 (and get older versions\\nof the tools), but they may not run completely cleanly.\\n\\n#### On Mac\\n\\nThe easiest thing to do is to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) and\\nuse `uv` and the `//run` script to develop things. See `./run --help` for\\nthe various commands that are supported. `glop` is the parser generator\\ntool used to generate a parser from the grammar in `json5/json5.g`.\\n\\n```\\n$ brew install uv\\n$ git clone https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5\\n$ git clone https://github.com/dpranke/glop\\n$ cd pyjson5\\n$ source $(./run devenv)  # To activate a venv w/ all the needed dev tools.\\n```\\n\\n#### On other platforms\\n\\nInstall `uv` via whatever mechanism is appropriate.\\n\\n### Create the venv\\n\\n```\\n$ ./run devenv\\n```\\n\\n(This calls `uv sync --extra dev`.)\\n\\n### Running the tests\\n\\n```\\n$ ./run tests\\n```\\n\\n### Updating the packages\\n\\n```\\n# Update the version in json5/version.py to $VERSION, which should be of\\n# the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are numbers.\\n$ ./run regen\\n$ ./run presubmit\\n$ git commit -a -m \\\"Bump the version to $VERSION\\\"\\n$ git tag \\\"v$VERSION\\\"\\n$ ./run build\\n$ ./run publish --prod\\n$ git push origin\\n$ git push --tags origin\\n```\\n\\n(Assuming you have upload privileges to PyPI and the GitHub repo, of course.)\\n\\n## Version History / Release Notes\\n\\n* v0.12.0 (2025-04-03)\\n    * Roll back pyproject.toml change for licensing so that we can still\\n      build the package on 3.8.\\n\\n* v0.12.0dev0 (prerelease)\\n    * Upgrade devenv package dependencies to latest versions; they now need\\n      Python 3.9 or newer, though json5 itself still supports 3.8.\\n\\n* v0.11.0 (2025-04-01)\\n    * Add a couple examples to the documentation and run doctest over\\n      them.\\n    * Fix a typing issue in dump and dumps with the `cls` argument; turns\\n      out mypy was right and I was wrong and I didn't realize it :).\\n    * Introduce a new `parse` method that can be used to iterate through\\n      a string, extracting multiple values.\\n    * Add a new `consume_trailing` parameter to `load`/`loads`/`parse`\\n      that specifies whether to keep parsing after a valid object is\\n      reached. By default, this is True and the string must only contain\\n      trailing whitespace. If set to False, parsing will stop when a\\n      valid object is reached.\\n    * Add a new `start` parameter to `load`/`loads`/`parse` to specify\\n      the zero-based offset to start parsing the string or file from.\\n    * [GitHub issue #60](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/60).\\n      Fix a bug where we were attempting to allow '--4' as a valid number.\\n\\n* v0.10.0 (2024-11-25)\\n    * [GitHub issue #57](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/57).\\n      Added a `JSON5Encoder` class that can be overridden to do custom\\n      encoding of values. This class is vaguely similar to the `JSONEncoder`\\n      class in the standard `json` library, except that it has an\\n      `encode()` method that can be overridden to customize *any*\\n      value, not just ones the standard encoder doesn't know how to handle.\\n      It does also support a `default()` method that can be used to\\n      encode things not normally encodable, like the JSONEncoder class.\\n      It does not support an `iterencode` method. One could probably\\n      be added in the future, although exactly how that would work and\\n      interact with `encode` is a little unclear.\\n    * Restructured the code to use the new encoder class; doing so actually\\n      allowed me to delete a bunch of tediously duplicative code.\\n    * Added a new `quote_style` argument to `dump()`/`dumps()` to control\\n      how strings are encoded by default. For compatibility with older\\n      versions of the json5 library and the standard json library, it\\n      uses `QuoteStyle.ALWAYS_DOUBLE` which encodes all strings with double\\n      quotes all the time. You can also configure it to use single quotes\\n      all the time (`ALWAYS_SINGLE`), and to switch between single and double\\n      when doing so eliminates a need to escape quotes (`PREFER_SINGLE` and\\n      `PREFER_DOUBLE`). This also adds a `--quote-style` argument to\\n      `python -m json5`.\\n    * This release has a fair number of changes, but is intended to be\\n      completely backwards-compatible. Code without changes should run exactly\\n      as it did before.\\n* v0.9.28 (2024-11-11)\\n    * Fix GitHub CI to install `uv` so `./run tests` works properly.\\n    * Mark Python3.13 as supported in package metadata.\\n    * Update dev package dependencies (note that the latest versions\\n      of coverage and pylint no longer work w/ Python3.8)\\n* v0.9.27 (2024-11-10)\\n    * Fix typo in //README.md\\n* v0.9.26 (2024-11-10)\\n    * [GitHub issue #82](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/82)\\n      Add support for the `strict` parameter to `load()`/`loads()`.\\n    * Significantly rework the infra and the `run` script to be\\n      contemporary.\\n* v0.9.25 (2024-04-12)\\n    * [GitHub issue #81](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/81)\\n      Explicitly specify the directory to use for the package in\\n      pyproject.toml.\\n* v0.9.24 (2024-03-16)\\n    * Update GitHub workflow config to remove unnecessary steps and\\n      run on pull requests as well as commits.\\n    * Added note about removing `hypothesize` in v0.9.23.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.23 (2024-03-16)\\n    * Lots of cleanup:\\n      * Removed old code needed for Python2 compatibility.\\n      * Removed tests using `hypothesize`. This ran model-based checks\\n        and didn't really add anything useful in terms of coverage to\\n        the test suite, and it introduced dependencies and slowed down\\n        the tests significantly. It was a good experiment but I think\\n        we're better off without it.\\n      * Got everything linting cleanly with pylint 3.1 and `ruff check`\\n        using ruff 0.3.3 (Note that commit message in 00d73a3 says pylint\\n        3.11, which is a typo).\\n      * Code reformatted with `ruff format`\\n      * Added missing tests to bring coverage up to 100%.\\n      * Lots of minor code changes as the result of linting and coverage\\n        testing, but no intentional functional differences.\\n* v0.9.22 (2024-03-06)\\n    * Attempt to fix the GitHub CI configuration now that setup.py\\n      is gone. Also, test on 3.12 instead of 3.11.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.21 (2024-03-06)\\n    * Moved the benchmarks/*.json data files' license information\\n      to //LICENSE to (hopefully) make the Google linter happy.\\n* v0.9.20 (2024-03-03)\\n    * Added `json5.__version__` in addition to `json5.VERSION`.\\n    * More packaging modernization (no more setup.{cfg,py} files).\\n    * Mark Python3.12 as supported in project.classifiers.\\n    * Updated the `//run` script to use python3.\\n* v0.9.19 (2024-03-03)\\n    * Replaced the benchmarking data files that came from chromium.org with\\n      three files obtained from other datasets on GitHub. Since this repo\\n      is vendored into the chromium/src repo it was occasionally confusing\\n      people who thought the data was actually used for non-benchmarking\\n      purposes and thus updating it for whatever reason.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.18 (2024-02-29)\\n    * Add typing information to the module. This is kind of a big change,\\n      but there should be no functional differences.\\n* v0.9.17 (2024-02-19)\\n    * Move from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`.\\n    * No code changes (other than the version increasing).\\n* v0.9.16 (2024-02-19)\\n    * Drop Python2 from `setup.py`\\n    * Add minimal packaging instructions to `//README.md`.\\n* v0.9.15 (2024-02-19)\\n    * Merge in [Pull request #66](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/66)\\n      to include the tests and sample file in a source distribution.\\n* v0.9.14 (2023-05-14)\\n    * [GitHub issue #63](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/63)\\n      Handle `+Infinity` as well as `-Infinity` and `Infinity`.\\n* v0.9.13 (2023-03-16)\\n    * [GitHub PR #64](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/64)\\n      Remove a field from one of the JSON benchmark files to\\n      reduce confusion in Chromium.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.12 (2023-01-02)\\n    * Fix GitHub Actions config file to no longer test against\\n      Python 3.6 or 3.7. For now we will only test against an\\n      \\\"oldest\\\" release (3.8 in this case) and a \\\"current\\\"\\n      release (3.11 in this case).\\n* v0.9.11 (2023-01-02)\\n    * [GitHub issue #60](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/60)\\n      Fixed minor Python2 compatibility issue by referring to\\n      `float(\\\"inf\\\")` instead of `math.inf`.\\n* v0.9.10 (2022-08-18)\\n    * [GitHub issue #58](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/58)\\n      Updated the //README.md to be clear that parsing arbitrary JS\\n      code may not work.\\n    * Otherwise, no code changes.\\n* v0.9.9 (2022-08-01)\\n    * [GitHub issue #57](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/57)\\n      Fixed serialization for objects that subclass `int` or `float`:\\n      Previously we would use the objects __str__ implementation, but\\n      that might result in an illegal JSON5 value if the object had\\n      customized __str__ to return something illegal. Instead,\\n      we follow the lead of the `JSON` module and call `int.__repr__`\\n      or `float.__repr__` directly.\\n    * While I was at it, I added tests for dumps(-inf) and dumps(nan)\\n      when those were supposed to be disallowed by `allow_nan=False`.\\n* v0.9.8 (2022-05-08)\\n    * [GitHub issue #47](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/47)\\n      Fixed error reporting in some cases due to how parsing was handling\\n      nested rules in the grammar - previously the reported location for\\n      the error could be far away from the point where it actually happened.\\n\\n* v0.9.7 (2022-05-06)\\n    * [GitHub issue #52](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/52)\\n      Fixed behavior of `default` fn in `dump` and `dumps`. Previously\\n      we didn't require the function to return a string, and so we could\\n      end up returning something that wasn't actually valid. This change\\n      now matches the behavior in the `json` module. *Note: This is a\\n      potentially breaking change.*\\n* v0.9.6 (2021-06-21)\\n    * Bump development status classifier to 5 - Production/Stable, which\\n      the library feels like it is at this point. If I do end up significantly\\n      reworking things to speed it up and/or to add round-trip editing,\\n      that'll likely be a 2.0. If this version has no reported issues,\\n      I'll likely promote it to 1.0.\\n    * Also bump the tested Python versions to 2.7, 3.8 and 3.9, though\\n      earlier Python3 versions will likely continue to work as well.\\n    * [GitHub issue #46](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/36)\\n      Fix incorrect serialization of custom subtypes\\n    * Make it possible to run the tests if `hypothesis` isn't installed.\\n\\n* v0.9.5 (2020-05-26)\\n    * Miscellaneous non-source cleanups in the repo, including setting\\n      up GitHub Actions for a CI system. No changes to the library from\\n      v0.9.4, other than updating the version.\\n\\n* v0.9.4 (2020-03-26)\\n    * [GitHub pull #38](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/38)\\n      Fix from fredrik@fornwall.net for dumps() crashing when passed\\n      an empty string as a key in an object.\\n\\n* v0.9.3 (2020-03-17)\\n    * [GitHub pull #35](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/35)\\n      Fix from pastelmind@ for dump() not passing the right args to dumps().\\n    * Fix from p.skouzos@novafutur.com to remove the tests directory from\\n      the setup call, making the package a bit smaller.\\n\\n* v0.9.2 (2020-03-02)\\n    * [GitHub pull #34](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/34)\\n      Fix from roosephu@ for a badly formatted nested list.\\n\\n* v0.9.1 (2020-02-09)\\n    * [GitHub issue #33](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/33):\\n       Fix stray trailing comma when dumping an object with an invalid key.\\n\\n* v0.9.0 (2020-01-30)\\n    * [GitHub issue #29](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/29):\\n       Fix an issue where objects keys that started with a reserved\\n       word were incorrectly quoted.\\n    * [GitHub issue #30](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/30):\\n       Fix an issue where dumps() incorrectly thought a data structure\\n       was cyclic in some cases.\\n    * [GitHub issue #32](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/32):\\n       Allow for non-string keys in dicts passed to ``dump()``/``dumps()``.\\n       Add an ``allow_duplicate_keys=False`` to prevent possible\\n       ill-formed JSON that might result.\\n\\n* v0.8.5 (2019-07-04)\\n    * [GitHub issue #25](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/25):\\n      Add LICENSE and README.md to the dist.\\n    * [GitHub issue #26](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/26):\\n      Fix printing of empty arrays and objects with indentation, fix\\n      misreporting of the position on parse failures in some cases.\\n\\n* v0.8.4 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Updated the version history, too.\\n\\n* v0.8.3 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Tweaked the README, bumped the version, forgot to update the version\\n      history :).\\n\\n* v0.8.2 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Actually bump the version properly, to 0.8.2.\\n\\n* v0.8.1 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Fix bug in setup.py that messed up the description. Unfortunately,\\n      I forgot to bump the version for this, so this also identifies as 0.8.0.\\n\\n* v0.8.0 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Add `allow_duplicate_keys=True` as a default argument to\\n      `json5.load()`/`json5.loads()`. If you set the key to `False`, duplicate\\n      keys in a single dict will be rejected. The default is set to `True`\\n      for compatibility with `json.load()`, earlier versions of json5, and\\n      because it's simply not clear if people would want duplicate checking\\n      enabled by default.\\n\\n* v0.7 (2019-03-31)\\n    * Changes dump()/dumps() to not quote object keys by default if they are\\n      legal identifiers. Passing `quote_keys=True` will turn that off\\n      and always quote object keys.\\n    * Changes dump()/dumps() to insert trailing commas after the last item\\n      in an array or an object if the object is printed across multiple lines\\n      (i.e., if `indent` is not None). Passing `trailing_commas=False` will\\n      turn that off.\\n    * The `json5.tool` command line tool now supports the `--indent`,\\n      `--[no-]quote-keys`, and `--[no-]trailing-commas` flags to allow\\n      for more control over the output, in addition to the existing\\n      `--as-json` flag.\\n    * The `json5.tool` command line tool no longer supports reading from\\n      multiple files, you can now only read from a single file or\\n      from standard input.\\n    * The implementation no longer relies on the standard `json` module\\n      for anything. The output should still match the json module (except\\n      as noted above) and discrepancies should be reported as bugs.\\n\\n* v0.6.2 (2019-03-08)\\n    * Fix [GitHub issue #23](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/23) and\\n      pass through unrecognized escape sequences.\\n\\n* v0.6.1 (2018-05-22)\\n    * Cleaned up a couple minor nits in the package.\\n\\n* v0.6.0 (2017-11-28)\\n    * First implementation that attempted to implement 100% of the spec.\\n\\n* v0.5.0 (2017-09-04)\\n    * First implementation that supported the full set of kwargs that\\n      the `json` module supports.\\n\",\n",

Sending HTTP requests.\\n\\nIt does not provide any high level model abstractions over the API,\\ndoes not handle redirects, multipart uploads, building authentication headers,\\ntransparent HTTP caching, URL parsing, session cookie handling,\\ncontent or charset decoding, handling JSON, environment based configuration\\ndefaults, or any of that Jazz.\\n\\nSome things HTTP Core does do:\\n\\n* Sending HTTP requests.\\n* Thread-safe / task-safe connection pooling.\\n* HTTP(S) proxy & SOCKS proxy support.\\n* Supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.\\n* Provides both sync and async interfaces.\\n* Async backend support for `asyncio` and `trio`.\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\nPython 3.8+\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nFor HTTP/1.1 only support, install with:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ pip install httpcore\\n```\\n\\nThere are also a number of optional extras available...\\n\\n```shell\\n$ pip install httpcore['asyncio,trio,http2,socks']\\n```\\n\\n## Sending requests\\n\\nSend an HTTP request:\\n\\n```python\\nimport httpcore\\n\\nresponse = httpcore.request(\\\"GET\\\", \\\"https://www.example.com/\\\")\\n\\nprint(response)\\n# <Response [200]>\\nprint(response.status)\\n# 200\\nprint(response.headers)\\n# [(b'Accept-Ranges', b'bytes'), (b'Age', b'557328'), (b'Cache-Control', b'max-age=604800'), ...]\\nprint(response.content)\\n# b'<!doctype html>\\\\n<html>\\\\n<head>\\\\n<title>Example Domain</title>\\\\n\\\\n<meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"/>\\\\n ...'\\n```\\n\\nThe top-level `httpcore.request()` function is provided for convenience. In practice whenever you're working with `httpcore` you'll want to use the connection pooling functionality that it provides.\\n\\n```python\\nimport httpcore\\n\\nhttp = httpcore.ConnectionPool()\\nresponse = http.request(\\\"GET\\\", \\\"https://www.example.com/\\\")\\n```\\n\\nOnce you're ready to get going, [head over to the documentation](https://www.encode.io/httpcore/).\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nYou *probably* don't want to be using HTTP Core directly. It might make sense if\\nyou're writing something like a proxy service in Python, and you just want\\nsomething at the lowest possible level, but more typically you'll want to use\\na higher level client library, such as `httpx`.\\n\\nThe motivation for `httpcore` is:\\n\\n* To provide a reusable low-level client library, that other packages can then build on top of.\\n* To provide a *really clear interface split* between the networking code and client logic,\\n  so that each is easier to understand and reason about in isolation.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\nThe `httpcore` package has the following dependencies...\\n\\n* `h11`\\n* `certifi`\\n\\nAnd the following optional extras...\\n\\n* `anyio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['asyncio']`.\\n* `trio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['trio']`.\\n* `h2` - Required by `pip install httpcore['http2']`.\\n* `socksio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['socks']`.\\n\\n## Versioning\\n\\nWe use [SEMVER for our versioning policy](https://semver.org/).\\n\\nFor changes between package versions please see our [project changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\nWe recommend pinning your requirements either the most current major version, or a more specific version range:\\n\\n```python\\npip install 'httpcore==1.*'\\n```\\n# Changelog\\n\\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\\n\\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\\n\\n## Version 1.0.9 (April 24th, 2025)\\n\\n- Resolve https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj with h11 dependency update.

This extension is needed for the HTTPX cli, in order to...\\n\\n* Log the point at which the connection is established, and the IP/port on which it is made.\\n* Determine if the outgoing request should log as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, rather than having to assume it's HTTP/2 if the --http2 flag was passed. (Which may not actually be true.)\\n* Log SSL version info / certificate info.\\n\\nNote that `curio` support is not currently available in 0.14.0. If you're using `httpcore` with `curio` please get in touch, so we can assess if we ought to prioritize it as a feature or not.\\n\\n## 0.13.7 (September 13th, 2021)\\n\\n- Fix broken error messaging when URL scheme is missing, or a non HTTP(S) scheme is used. (Pull #403)\\n\\n## 0.13.6 (June 15th, 2021)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Close sockets when read or write timeouts occur. (Pull #365)\\n\\n## 0.13.5 (June 14th, 2021)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Resolved niggles with AnyIO EOF behaviours. (Pull #358, #362)\\n\\n## 0.13.4 (June 9th, 2021)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Improved error messaging when URL scheme is missing, or a non HTTP(S) scheme is used. (Pull #354)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Switched to `anyio` as the default backend implementation when running with `asyncio`. Resolves some awkward [TLS timeout issues](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1511).\\n\\n## 0.13.3 (May 6th, 2021)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Support HTTP/2 prior knowledge, using `httpcore.SyncConnectionPool(http1=False)`. (Pull #333)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Handle cases where environment does not provide `select.poll` support. (Pull #331)\\n\\n## 0.13.2 (April 29th, 2021)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Improve error message for specific case of `RemoteProtocolError` where server disconnects without sending a response. (Pull #313)\\n\\n## 0.13.1 (April 28th, 2021)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- More resiliant testing for closed connections. (Pull #311)\\n- Don't raise exceptions on ungraceful connection closes. (Pull #310)\\n\\n## 0.13.0 (April 21st, 2021)\\n\\nThe 0.13 release updates the core API in order to match the HTTPX Transport API,\\nintroduced in HTTPX 0.18 onwards.\\n\\nAn example of making requests with the new interface is:\\n\\n```python\\nwith httpcore.SyncConnectionPool() as http:\\n    status_code, headers, stream, extensions = http.handle_request(\\n        method=b'GET',\\n        url=(b'https', b'example.org', 443, b'/'),\\n        headers=[(b'host', b'example.org'), (b'user-agent', b'httpcore')]\\n        stream=httpcore.ByteStream(b''),\\n        extensions={}\\n    )\\n    body = stream.read()\\n    print(status_code, body)\\n```\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- The `.request()` method is now `handle_request()`. (Pull #296)\\n- The `.arequest()` method is now `.handle_async_request()`. (Pull #296)\\n- The `headers` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\\n- The `stream` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\\n- The `ext` argument is now named `extensions`, and is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\\n- The `\\\"reason\\\"` extension keyword is now named `\\\"reason_phrase\\\"`. (Pull #296)\\n- The `\\\"reason_phrase\\\"` and `\\\"http_version\\\"` extensions now use byte strings for their values. (Pull #296)\\n- The `httpcore.PlainByteStream()` class becomes `httpcore.ByteStream()`. (Pull #296)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Streams now support a `.read()` interface. (Pull #296)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Task cancellation no longer leaks connections from the connection pool. (Pull #305)\\n\\n## 0.12.3 (December 7th, 2020)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Abort SSL connections on close rather than waiting for remote EOF when using `asyncio`.  (Pull #167)\\n- Fix exception raised in case of connect timeouts when using the `anyio` backend. (Pull #236)\\n- Fix `Host` header precedence for `:authority` in HTTP/2. (Pull #241, #243)\\n- Handle extra edge case when detecting for socket readability when using `asyncio`. (Pull #242, #244)\\n- Fix `asyncio` SSL warning when using proxy tunneling. (Pull #249)\\n\\n## 0.12.2 (November 20th, 2020)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Properly wrap connect errors on the asyncio backend. (Pull #235)\\n- Fix `ImportError` occurring on Python 3.9 when using the HTTP/1.1 sync client in a multithreaded context. (Pull #237)\\n\\n## 0.12.1 (November 7th, 2020)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Add connect retries. (Pull #221)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Tweak detection of dropped connections, resolving an issue with open files limits on Linux. (Pull #185)\\n- Avoid leaking connections when establishing an HTTP tunnel to a proxy has failed. (Pull #223)\\n- Properly wrap OS errors when using `trio`. (Pull #225)\\n\\n## 0.12.0 (October 6th, 2020)\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- HTTP header casing is now preserved, rather than always sent in lowercase. (#216 and python-hyper/h11#104)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Add Python 3.9 to officially supported versions.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Gracefully handle a stdlib asyncio bug when a connection is closed while it is in a paused-for-reading state. (#201)\\n\\n## 0.11.1 (September 28nd, 2020)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Add await to async semaphore release() coroutine (#197)\\n- Drop incorrect curio classifier (#192)\\n\\n## 0.11.0 (September 22nd, 2020)\\n\\nThe Transport API with 0.11.0 has a couple of significant changes.\\n\\nFirstly we've moved changed the request interface in order to allow extensions, which will later enable us to support features\\nsuch as trailing headers, HTTP/2 server push, and CONNECT/Upgrade connections.\\n\\nThe interface changes from:\\n\\n```python\\ndef request(method, url, headers, stream, timeout):\\n    return (http_version, status_code, reason, headers, stream)\\n```\\n\\nTo instead including an optional dictionary of extensions on the request and response:\\n\\n```python\\ndef request(method, url, headers, stream, ext):\\n    return (status_code, headers, stream, ext)\\n```\\n\\nHaving an open-ended extensions point will allow us to add later support for various optional features, that wouldn't otherwise be supported without these API changes.\\n\\nIn particular:\\n\\n* Trailing headers support.\\n* HTTP/2 Server Push\\n* sendfile.\\n* Exposing raw connection on CONNECT, Upgrade, HTTP/2 bi-di streaming.\\n* Exposing debug information out of the API, including template name, template context.\\n\\nCurrently extensions are limited to:\\n\\n* request: `timeout` - Optional. Timeout dictionary.\\n* response: `http_version` - Optional. Include the HTTP version used on the response.\\n* response: `reason` - Optional. Include the reason phrase used on the response. Only valid with HTTP/1.*.\\n\\nSee https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/1274#issuecomment-694884553 for the history behind this.\\n\\nSecondly, the async version of `request` is now namespaced as `arequest`.\\n\\nThis allows concrete transports to support both sync and async implementations on the same class.\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Add curio support. (Pull #168)\\n- Add anyio support, with `backend=\\\"anyio\\\"`. (Pull #169)\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- Update the Transport API to use 'ext' for optional extensions. (Pull #190)\\n- Update the Transport API to use `.request` and `.arequest` so implementations can support both sync and async. (Pull #189)\\n\\n## 0.10.2 (August 20th, 2020)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Added Unix Domain Socket support. (Pull #139)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Always include the port on proxy CONNECT requests. (Pull #154)\\n- Fix `max_keepalive_connections` configuration. (Pull #153)\\n- Fixes behaviour in HTTP/1.1 where server disconnects can be used to signal the end of the response body. (Pull #164)\\n\\n## 0.10.1 (August 7th, 2020)\\n\\n- Include `max_keepalive_connections` on `AsyncHTTPProxy`/`SyncHTTPProxy` classes.\\n\\n## 0.10.0 (August 7th, 2020)\\n\\nThe most notable change in the 0.10.0 release is that HTTP/2 support is now fully optional.\\n\\nUse either `pip install httpcore` for HTTP/1.1 support only, or `pip install httpcore[http2]` for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support.\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- HTTP/2 support becomes optional. (Pull #121, #130)\\n- Add `local_address=...` support. (Pull #100, #134)\\n- Add `PlainByteStream`, `IteratorByteStream`, `AsyncIteratorByteStream`.

It is released under a two-clauses\\nBSD license, i.e. basically you can do whatever you want with it but I am not\\nresponsible.\\n\\nInstallation\\n-------------\\n\\nIf you are lazy, just perform\\n\\n ``$ pip install decorator``\\n\\nwhich will install just the module on your system.\\n\\nIf you prefer to install the full distribution from source, including\\nthe documentation, clone the `GitHub repo`_ or download the tarball_, unpack it and run\\n\\n ``$ pip install .``\\n\\nin the main directory, possibly as superuser.\\n\\n.. _tarball: https://pypi.org/project/decorator/#files\\n.. _GitHub repo: https://github.com/micheles/decorator\\n\\nTesting\\n--------\\n\\nIf you have the source code installation you can run the tests with\\n\\n `$ python src/tests/test.py -v`\\n\\nor (if you have setuptools installed)\\n\\n `$ python setup.py test`\\n\\nNotice that you may run into trouble if in your system there\\nis an older version of the decorator module; in such a case remove the\\nold version. It is safe even to copy the module `decorator.py` over\\nan existing one, since we kept backward-compatibility for a long time.\\n\\nRepository\\n---------------\\n\\nThe project is hosted on GitHub. You can look at the source here:\\n\\n https://github.com/micheles/decorator\\n\\nDocumentation\\n---------------\\n\\nThe documentation has been moved to https://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/master/docs/documentation.md\\n\\nFrom there you can get a PDF version by simply using the print\\nfunctionality of your browser.\\n\\nHere is the documentation for previous versions of the module:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.3.2/docs/tests.documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.2.1/docs/tests.documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.1.2/docs/tests.documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.0.0/documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/3.4.2/documentation.rst\\n\\nFor the impatient\\n-----------------\\n\\nHere is an example of how to define a family of decorators tracing slow\\noperations:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n   from decorator import decorator\\n\\n   @decorator\\n   def warn_slow(func, timelimit=60, *args, **kw):\\n       t0 = time.time()\\n       result = func(*args, **kw)\\n       dt = time.time() - t0\\n       if dt > timelimit:\\n           logging.warning('%s took %d seconds', func.__name__, dt)\\n       else:\\n           logging.info('%s took %d seconds', func.__name__, dt)\\n       return result\\n\\n   @warn_slow  # warn if it takes more than 1 minute\\n   def preprocess_input_files(inputdir, tempdir):\\n       ...\\n\\n   @warn_slow(timelimit=600)  # warn if it takes more than 10 minutes\\n   def run_calculation(tempdir, outdir):\\n       ...\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\",\n",

Note that this requires Cython to\\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home page.\\n\\n\\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become available at\\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-6.0 .\\nRunning ``pip install https://github.com/lxml/lxml/archive/refs/heads/lxml-6.0.tar.gz``\\nwill install the unreleased branch state as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.\\nNote that this requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\\n\\n6.0.0 (2025-06-26)\\n==================\\n\\nFeatures added\\n--------------\\n\\n* GH#463: ``lxml.html.diff`` is faster and provides structurally better diffs.\\n  Original patch by Steven Fernandez.\\n\\n* GH#405: The factories ``Element`` and ``ElementTree`` can now be used in type hints.\\n\\n* GH#448: Parsing from ``memoryview`` and other buffers is supported to allow zero-copy parsing.\\n\\n* GH#437: ``lxml.html.builder`` was missing several HTML5 tag names.\\n  Patch by Nick Tarleton.\\n\\n* GH#458: ``CDATA`` can now be written into the incremental ``xmlfile()`` writer.\\n  Original patch by Lane Shaw.\\n\\n* A new parser option ``decompress=False`` was added that controls the automatic\\n  input decompression when using libxml2 2.15.0 or later.  Disabling this option\\n  by default will effectively prevent decompression bombs when handling untrusted\\n  input.  Code that depends on automatic decompression must enable this option.\\n  Note that libxml2 2.15.0 was not released yet, so this option currently has no\\n  effect but can already be used.\\n\\n* The set of compile time / runtime supported libxml2 feature names is available as\\n  ``etree.LIBXML_COMPILED_FEATURES`` and ``etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.\\n  This currently includes\\n  ``catalog``, ``ftp``, ``html``, ``http``, ``iconv``, ``icu``,\\n  ``lzma``, ``regexp``, ``schematron``, ``xmlschema``, ``xpath``, ``zlib``.\\n\\nBugs fixed\\n----------\\n\\n* GH#353: Predicates in ``.find*()`` could mishandle tag indices if a default namespace is provided.\\n  Original patch by Luise K.\\n\\n* GH#272: The ``head`` and ``body`` properties of ``lxml.html`` elements failed if no such element\\n  was found.  They now return ``None`` instead.\\n  Original patch by FVolral.\\n\\n* Tag names provided by code (API, not data) that are longer than ``INT_MAX``\\n  could be truncated or mishandled in other ways.\\n\\n* ``.text_content()`` on ``lxml.html`` elements accidentally returned a \\\"smart string\\\"\\n  without additional information.  It now returns a plain string.\\n\\n* LP#2109931: When building lxml with coverage reporting, it now disables the ``sys.monitoring``\\n  support due to the lack of support in https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1790\\n\\nOther changes\\n-------------\\n\\n* Support for Python < 3.8 was removed.\\n\\n* Parsing directly from zlib (or lzma) compressed data is now considered an optional\\n  feature in lxml.  It may get removed from libxml2 at some point for security reasons\\n  (compression bombs) and is therefore no longer guaranteed to be available in lxml.\\n\\n  As of this release, zlib support is still normally available in the binary wheels\\n  but may get disabled or removed in later (x.y.0) releases.  To test the availability,\\n  use ``\\\"zlib\\\" in etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.\\n\\n* The ``Schematron`` class is deprecated and will become non-functional in a future lxml version.\\n  The feature will soon be removed from libxml2 and stop being available.\\n\\n* GH#438: Wheels include the ``arm7l`` target.\\n\\n* GH#465: Windows wheels include the ``arm64`` target.\\n  Patch by Finn Womack.\\n\\n* Binary wheels use the library versions libxml2 2.14.4 and libxslt 1.1.43.\\n  Note that this disables direct HTTP and FTP support for parsing from URLs.\\n  Use Python URL request tools instead (which usually also support HTTPS).\\n  To test the availability, use ``\\\"http\\\" in etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.\\n\\n* Windows binary wheels use the library versions libxml2 2.11.9, libxslt 1.1.39 and libiconv 1.17.\\n  They are now based on VS-2022.\\n\\n* Built using Cython 3.1.2.\\n\\n* The debug methods ``MemDebug.dump()`` and ``MemDebug.show()`` were removed completely.\\n  libxml2 2.13.0 discarded this feature.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms\\nof data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full Python\\nHTTP implementation.\\n\\nTo install it, just run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    $ python -m pip install h2\\n\\nDocumentation\\n=============\\n\\nDocumentation is available at https://h2.readthedocs.io .\\n\\nContributing\\n============\\n\\n``h2`` welcomes contributions from anyone!

The target are\\nsmall apps that would be blown away by a SQL-DB or an external database server.\\n\\nTinyDB is:\\n\\n- **tiny:** The current source code has 1800 lines of code (with about 40%\\n  documentation) and 1600 lines tests.\\n\\n- **document oriented:** Like MongoDB_, you can store any document\\n  (represented as ``dict``) in TinyDB.\\n\\n- **optimized for your happiness:** TinyDB is designed to be simple and\\n  fun to use by providing a simple and clean API.\\n\\n- **written in pure Python:** TinyDB neither needs an external server (as\\n  e.g. `PyMongo <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_) nor any dependencies\\n  from PyPI.\\n\\n- **works on Python 3.8+ and PyPy3:** TinyDB works on all modern versions of Python\\n  and PyPy.\\n\\n- **powerfully extensible:** You can easily extend TinyDB by writing new\\n  storages or modify the behaviour of storages with Middlewares.\\n\\n- **100% test coverage:** No explanation needed.\\n\\nTo dive straight into all the details, head over to the `TinyDB docs\\n<https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/>`_. You can also discuss everything related\\nto TinyDB like general development, extensions or showcase your TinyDB-based\\nprojects on the `discussion forum <http://forum.m-siemens.de/.>`_.\\n\\nSupported Python Versions\\n*************************\\n\\nTinyDB has been tested with Python 3.8 - 3.13 and PyPy3.\\n\\nProject Status\\n**************\\n\\nThis project is in maintenance mode. It has reached a mature, stable state\\nwhere significant new features or architectural changes are not planned. That\\nsaid, there will still be releases for bugfixes or features contributed by\\nthe community. Read more about what this means in particular\\n`here <https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb/discussions/572>`_.\\n\\nExample Code\\n************\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from tinydb import TinyDB, Query\\n    >>> db = TinyDB('/path/to/db.json')\\n    >>> db.insert({'int': 1, 'char': 'a'})\\n    >>> db.insert({'int': 1, 'char': 'b'})\\n\\nQuery Language\\n==============\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> User = Query()\\n    >>> # Search for a field value\\n    >>> db.search(User.name == 'John')\\n    [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'John', 'age': 37}]\\n\\n    >>> # Combine two queries with logical and\\n    >>> db.search((User.name == 'John') & (User.age <= 30))\\n    [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}]\\n\\n    >>> # Combine two queries with logical or\\n    >>> db.search((User.name == 'John') | (User.name == 'Bob'))\\n    [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'John', 'age': 37}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 42}]\\n\\n    >>> # Negate a query with logical not\\n    >>> db.search(~(User.name == 'John'))\\n    [{'name': 'Megan', 'age': 27}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 42}]\\n\\n    >>> # Apply transformation to field with `map`\\n    >>> db.search((User.age.map(lambda x: x + x) == 44))\\n    >>> [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}]\\n\\n    >>> # More possible comparisons:  !=  <  >  <=  >=\\n    >>> # More possible checks: where(...).matches(regex), where(...).test(your_test_func)\\n\\nTables\\n======\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> table = db.table('name')\\n    >>> table.insert({'value': True})\\n    >>> table.all()\\n    [{'value': True}]\\n\\nUsing Middlewares\\n=================\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from tinydb.storages import JSONStorage\\n    >>> from tinydb.middlewares import CachingMiddleware\\n    >>> db = TinyDB('/path/to/db.json', storage=CachingMiddleware(JSONStorage))\\n\\n\\nContributing\\n************\\n\\nWhether reporting bugs, discussing improvements and new ideas or writing\\nextensions: Contributions to TinyDB are welcome! Here's how to get started:\\n\\n1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around\\n   a feature idea or a bug\\n2. Fork `the repository <https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb/>`_ on Github,\\n   create a new branch off the `master` branch and start making your changes\\n   (known as `GitHub Flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_)\\n3. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works\\n   as expected\\n4. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and\\n   published ☺\\n\\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/azure-devops/build/msiemens/3e5baa75-12ec-43ac-9728-89823ee8c7e2/2.svg?style=flat-square\\n   :target: https://dev.azure.com/msiemens/github/_build?definitionId=2\\n.. |Coverage| image:: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/msiemens/tinydb.svg?style=flat-square\\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/msiemens/tinydb\\n.. |Version| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tinydb.svg?style=flat-square\\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinydb/\\n.. _Buzhug: http://buzhug.sourceforge.net/\\n.. _CodernityDB: https://github.com/perchouli/codernitydb\\n.. _MongoDB: http://mongodb.org/\\n\\n\",\n",

Only one instance of the class is created for each filename. Subclassing it to add more attributes on creation or methods is recommended. The classmethods such as `executing` will respect this. See the source code and docstrings for more detail.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n    pip install executing\\n\\nIf you don't like that you can just copy the file `executing.py`, there are no dependencies (but of course you won't get updates).\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nSuppose the frame is executing this line:\\n\\n```python\\nself.foo(bar.x)\\n```\\n\\nand in particular it's currently obtaining the attribute `self.foo`. Looking at the bytecode, specifically `frame.f_code.co_code[frame.f_lasti]`, we can tell that it's loading an attribute, but it's not obvious which one. We can narrow down the statement being executed using `frame.f_lineno` and find the two `ast.Attribute` nodes representing `self.foo` and `bar.x`. How do we find out which one it is, without recreating the entire compiler in Python?\\n\\nThe trick is to modify the AST slightly for each candidate expression and observe the changes in the bytecode instructions. We change the AST to this:\\n\\n```python\\n(self.foo ** 'longuniqueconstant')(bar.x)\\n```\\n    \\nand compile it, and the bytecode will be almost the same but there will be two new instructions:\\n\\n    LOAD_CONST 'longuniqueconstant'\\n    BINARY_POWER\\n\\nand just before that will be a `LOAD_ATTR` instruction corresponding to `self.foo`. Seeing that it's in the same position as the original instruction lets us know we've found our match.\\n\\n## Is it reliable?\\n\\nYes - if it identifies a node, you can trust that it's identified the correct one. The tests are very thorough - in addition to unit tests which check various situations directly, there are property tests against a large number of files (see the filenames printed in [this build](https://travis-ci.org/alexmojaki/executing/jobs/557970457)) with real code. Specifically, for each file, the tests:\\n \\n 1. Identify as many nodes as possible from all the bytecode instructions in the file, and assert that they are all distinct\\n 2. Find all the nodes that should be identifiable, and assert that they were indeed identified somewhere\\n\\nIn other words, it shows that there is a one-to-one mapping between the nodes and the instructions that can be handled. This leaves very little room for a bug to creep in.\\n\\nFurthermore, `executing` checks that the instructions compiled from the modified AST exactly match the original code save for a few small known exceptions. This accounts for all the quirks and optimisations in the interpreter. \\n\\n## Which nodes can it identify?\\n\\nCurrently it works in almost all cases for the following `ast` nodes:\\n \\n - `Call`, e.g. `self.foo(bar)`\\n - `Attribute`, e.g. `point.x`\\n - `Subscript`, e.g. `lst[1]`\\n - `BinOp`, e.g. `x + y` (doesn't include `and` and `or`)\\n - `UnaryOp`, e.g. `-n` (includes `not` but only works sometimes)\\n - `Compare` e.g. `a < b` (not for chains such as `0 < p < 1`)\\n\\nThe plan is to extend to more operations in the future.\\n\\n## Projects that use this\\n\\n### My Projects\\n\\n- **[`stack_data`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/stack_data)**: Extracts data from stack frames and tracebacks, particularly to display more useful tracebacks than the default. Also uses another related library of mine: **[`pure_eval`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/pure_eval)**.\\n- **[`futurecoder`](https://futurecoder.io/)**: Highlights the executing node in tracebacks using `executing` via `stack_data`, and provides debugging with `snoop`.\\n- **[`snoop`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop)**: A feature-rich and convenient debugging library. Uses `executing` to show the operation which caused an exception and to allow the `pp` function to display the source of its arguments.\\n- **[`heartrate`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/heartrate)**: A simple real time visualisation of the execution of a Python program. Uses `executing` to highlight currently executing operations, particularly in each frame of the stack trace.\\n- **[`sorcery`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/sorcery)**: Dark magic delights in Python. Uses `executing` to let special callables called spells know where they're being called from.\\n\\n### Projects I've contributed to\\n\\n- **[`IPython`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12150)**: Highlights the executing node in tracebacks using `executing` via [`stack_data`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/stack_data).\\n- **[`icecream`](https://github.com/gruns/icecream)**: 🍦 Sweet and creamy print debugging. Uses `executing` to identify where `ic` is called and print its arguments.\\n- **[`friendly_traceback`](https://github.com/friendly-traceback/friendly-traceback)**: Uses `stack_data` and `executing` to pinpoint the cause of errors and provide helpful explanations.\\n- **[`python-devtools`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/python-devtools)**: Uses `executing` for print debugging similar to `icecream`.\\n- **[`sentry_sdk`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python)**: Add the integration `sentry_sdk.integrations.executingExecutingIntegration()` to show the function `__qualname__` in each frame in sentry events.\\n- **[`varname`](https://github.com/pwwang/python-varname)**: Dark magics about variable names in python.

It powers the tracebacks in IPython and [futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io/):\\n\\n![futurecoder example](https://futurecoder.io/static/img/features/traceback.png)\\n\\nYou can install it from PyPI:\\n\\n    pip install stack_data\\n    \\n## Basic usage\\n\\nHere's some code we'd like to inspect:\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo():\\n    result = []\\n    for i in range(5):\\n        row = []\\n        result.append(row)\\n        print_stack()\\n        for j in range(5):\\n            row.append(i * j)\\n    return result\\n```\\n\\nNote that `foo` calls a function `print_stack()`. In reality we can imagine that an exception was raised at this line, or a debugger stopped there, but this is easy to play with directly. Here's a basic implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport inspect\\nimport stack_data\\n\\n\\ndef print_stack():\\n    frame = inspect.currentframe().f_back\\n    frame_info = stack_data.FrameInfo(frame)\\n    print(f\\\"{frame_info.code.co_name} at line {frame_info.lineno}\\\")\\n    print(\\\"-----------\\\")\\n    for line in frame_info.lines:\\n        print(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render()}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n(Beware that this has a major bug - it doesn't account for line gaps, which we'll learn about later)\\n\\nThe output of one call to `print_stack()` looks like:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 9\\n-----------\\n       6 | for i in range(5):\\n       7 |     row = []\\n       8 |     result.append(row)\\n-->    9 |     print_stack()\\n      10 |     for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nThe code for `print_stack()` is fairly self-explanatory. If you want to learn more details about a particular class or method I suggest looking through some docstrings. `FrameInfo` is a class that accepts either a frame or a traceback object and provides a bunch of nice attributes and properties (which are cached so you don't need to worry about performance). In particular `frame_info.lines` is a list of `Line` objects. `line.render()` returns the source code of that line suitable for display. Without any arguments it simply strips any common leading indentation. Later on we'll see a more powerful use for it.\\n\\nYou can see that `frame_info.lines` includes some lines of surrounding context. By default it includes 3 pieces of context before the main line and 1 piece after. We can configure the amount of context by passing options:\\n\\n```python\\noptions = stack_data.Options(before=1, after=0)\\nframe_info = stack_data.FrameInfo(frame, options)\\n```\\n\\nThen the output looks like:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 9\\n-----------\\n       8 | result.append(row)\\n-->    9 | print_stack()\\n```\\n\\nNote that these parameters are not the number of *lines* before and after to include, but the number of *pieces*. A piece is a range of one or more lines in a file that should logically be grouped together. A piece contains either a single simple statement or a part of a compound statement (loops, if, try/except, etc) that doesn't contain any other statements. Most pieces are a single line, but a multi-line statement or `if` condition is a single piece. In the example above, all pieces are one line, because nothing is spread across multiple lines. If we change our code to include some multiline bits:\\n\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo():\\n    result = []\\n    for i in range(5):\\n        row = []\\n        result.append(\\n            row\\n        )\\n        print_stack()\\n        for j in range(\\n                5\\n        ):\\n            row.append(i * j)\\n    return result\\n```\\n\\nand then run the original code with the default options, then the output is:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 11\\n-----------\\n       6 | for i in range(5):\\n       7 |     row = []\\n       8 |     result.append(\\n       9 |         row\\n      10 |     )\\n-->   11 |     print_stack()\\n      12 |     for j in range(\\n      13 |             5\\n      14 |     ):\\n```\\n\\nNow lines 8-10 and lines 12-14 are each a single piece. Note that the output is essentially the same as the original in terms of the amount of code. The division of files into pieces means that the edge of the context is intuitive and doesn't crop out parts of statements or expressions. For example, if context was measured in lines instead of pieces, the last line of the above would be `for j in range(` which is much less useful.\\n\\nHowever, if a piece is very long, including all of it could be cumbersome. For this, `Options` has a parameter `max_lines_per_piece`, which is 6 by default. Suppose we have a piece in our code that's longer than that:\\n\\n```python\\n        row = [\\n            1,\\n            2,\\n            3,\\n            4,\\n            5,\\n        ]\\n```\\n\\n`frame_info.lines` will truncate this piece so that instead of 7 `Line` objects it will produce 5 `Line` objects and one `LINE_GAP` in the middle, making 6 objects in total for the piece. Our code doesn't currently handle gaps, so it will raise an exception. We can modify it like so:\\n\\n```python\\n    for line in frame_info.lines:\\n        if line is stack_data.LINE_GAP:\\n            print(\\\"       (...)\\\")\\n        else:\\n            print(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render()}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNow the output looks like:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 15\\n-----------\\n       6 | for i in range(5):\\n       7 |     row = [\\n       8 |         1,\\n       9 |         2,\\n       (...)\\n      12 |         5,\\n      13 |     ]\\n      14 |     result.append(row)\\n-->   15 |     print_stack()\\n      16 |     for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can flip the condition around and check `if isinstance(line, stack_data.Line):`. Either way, you should always check for line gaps, or your code may appear to work at first but fail when it encounters a long piece.\\n\\nNote that the executing piece, i.e. the piece containing the current line being executed (line 15 in this case) is never truncated, no matter how long it is.\\n\\nThe lines of context never stray outside `frame_info.scope`, which is the innermost function or class definition containing the current line. For example, this is the output for a short function which has neither 3 lines before nor 1 line after the current line:\\n\\n```\\nbar at line 6\\n-----------\\n       4 | def bar():\\n       5 |     foo()\\n-->    6 |     print_stack()\\n```\\n\\nSometimes it's nice to ensure that the function signature is always showing. This can be done with `Options(include_signature=True)`. The result looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 14\\n-----------\\n       9 | def foo():\\n       (...)\\n      11 |     for i in range(5):\\n      12 |         row = []\\n      13 |         result.append(row)\\n-->   14 |         print_stack()\\n      15 |         for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nTo avoid wasting space, pieces never start or end with a blank line, and blank lines between pieces are excluded. So if our code looks like this:\\n\\n\\n```python\\n    for i in range(5):\\n        row = []\\n\\n        result.append(row)\\n        print_stack()\\n\\n        for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nThe output doesn't change much, except you can see jumps in the line numbers:\\n\\n```\\n      11 |     for i in range(5):\\n      12 |         row = []\\n      14 |         result.append(row)\\n-->   15 |         print_stack()\\n      17 |         for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\n## Variables\\n\\nYou can also inspect variables and other expressions in a frame, e.g:\\n\\n```python\\n    for var in frame_info.variables:\\n        print(f\\\"{var.name} = {repr(var.value)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nwhich may output:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], [0, 3, 6, 9, 12], []]\\ni = 4\\nrow = []\\nj = 4\\n```\\n\\n`frame_info.variables` returns a list of `Variable` objects, which have attributes `name`, `value`, and `nodes`, which is a list of all AST representing that expression.\\n\\nA `Variable` may refer to an expression other than a simple variable name. It can be any expression evaluated by the library [`pure_eval`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/pure_eval) which it deems 'interesting' (see those docs for more info). This includes expressions like `foo.bar` or `foo[bar]`. In these cases `name` is the source code of that expression. `pure_eval` ensures that it only evaluates expressions that won't have any side effects, e.g. where `foo.bar` is a normal attribute rather than a descriptor such as a property.\\n\\n`frame_info.variables` is a list of all the interesting expressions found in `frame_info.scope`, e.g. the current function, which may include expressions not visible in `frame_info.lines`. You can restrict the list by using `frame_info.variables_in_lines` or even `frame_info.variables_in_executing_piece`. For more control you can use `frame_info.variables_by_lineno`. See the docstrings for more information.\\n\\n## Rendering lines with ranges and markers\\n\\nSometimes you may want to insert special characters into the text for display purposes, e.g. HTML or ANSI color codes. `stack_data` provides a few tools to make this easier.\\n\\nLet's say we have a `Line` object where `line.text` (the original raw source code of that line) is `\\\"foo = bar\\\"`, so `line.text[6:9]` is `\\\"bar\\\"`, and we want to emphasise that part by inserting HTML at positions 6 and 9 in the text. Here's how we can do that directly:\\n\\n```python\\nmarkers = [\\n    stack_data.MarkerInLine(position=6, is_start=True, string=\\\"<b>\\\"),\\n    stack_data.MarkerInLine(position=9, is_start=False, string=\\\"</b>\\\"),\\n]\\nline.render(markers)  # returns \\\"foo = <b>bar</b>\\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere `is_start=True` indicates that the marker is the first of a pair. This helps `line.render()` sort and insert the markers correctly so you don't end up with malformed HTML like `foo<b>.<i></b>bar</i>` where tags overlap.\\n\\nSince we're inserting HTML, we should actually use `line.render(markers, escape_html=True)` which will escape special HTML characters in the Python source (but not the markers) so for example `foo = bar < spam` would be rendered as `foo = <b>bar</b> &lt; spam`.\\n\\nUsually though you wouldn't create markers directly yourself. Instead you would start with one or more ranges and then convert them, like so:\\n\\n```python\\nranges = [\\n    stack_data.RangeInLine(start=0, end=3, data=\\\"foo\\\"),\\n    stack_data.RangeInLine(start=6, end=9, data=\\\"bar\\\"),\\n]\\n\\ndef convert_ranges(r):\\n    if r.data == \\\"bar\\\":\\n        return \\\"<b>\\\", \\\"</b>\\\"        \\n\\n# This results in `markers` being the same as in the above example.\\nmarkers = stack_data.markers_from_ranges(ranges, convert_ranges)\\n```\\n\\n`RangeInLine` has a `data` attribute which can be any object. `markers_from_ranges` accepts a converter function to which it passes all the `RangeInLine` objects. If the converter function returns a pair of strings, it creates two markers from them. Otherwise it should return `None` to indicate that the range should be ignored, as with the first range containing `\\\"foo\\\"` in this example.\\n\\nThe reason this is useful is because there are built in tools to create these ranges for you. For example, if we change our `print_stack()` function to contain this:\\n\\n```python\\ndef convert_variable_ranges(r):\\n    variable, _node = r.data\\n    return f'<span data-value=\\\"{repr(variable.value)}\\\">', '</span>'\\n\\nmarkers = stack_data.markers_from_ranges(line.variable_ranges, convert_variable_ranges)\\nprint(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render(markers, escape_html=True)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nThen the output becomes:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 15\\n-----------\\n       9 | def foo():\\n       (...)\\n      11 |     for <span data-value=\\\"4\\\">i</span> in range(5):\\n      12 |         <span data-value=\\\"[]\\\">row</span> = []\\n      14 |         <span data-value=\\\"[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], [0, 3, 6, 9, 12], []]\\\">result</span>.append(<span data-value=\\\"[]\\\">row</span>)\\n-->   15 |         print_stack()\\n      17 |         for <span data-value=\\\"4\\\">j</span> in range(5):\\n```\\n\\n`line.variable_ranges` is a list of RangeInLines for each Variable that appears at least partially in this line. The data attribute of the range is a pair `(variable, node)` where node is the particular AST node from the list `variable.nodes` that corresponds to this range.\\n\\nYou can also use `line.token_ranges` (e.g. if you want to do your own syntax highlighting) or `line.executing_node_ranges` if you want to highlight the currently executing node identified by the [`executing`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing) library. Or if you want to make your own range from an AST node, use `line.range_from_node(node, data)`. See the docstrings for more info.\\n\\n### Syntax highlighting with Pygments\\n\\nIf you'd like pretty colored text without the work, you can let [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) do it for you. Just follow these steps:\\n\\n1. `pip install pygments` separately as it's not a dependency of `stack_data`.\\n2. Create a pygments formatter object such as `HtmlFormatter` or `Terminal256Formatter`.\\n3. Pass the formatter to `Options` in the argument `pygments_formatter`.\\n4. Use `line.render(pygmented=True)` to get your formatted text. In this case you can't pass any markers to `render`.\\n\\nIf you want, you can also highlight the executing node in the frame in combination with the pygments syntax highlighting. For this you will need:\\n\\n1. A pygments style - either a style class or a string that names it. See the [documentation on styles](https://pygments.org/docs/styles/) and the [styles gallery](https://blog.yjl.im/2015/08/pygments-styles-gallery.html).\\n2. A modification to make to the style for the executing node, which is a string such as `\\\"bold\\\"` or `\\\"bg:#ffff00\\\"` (yellow background). See the [documentation on style rules](https://pygments.org/docs/styles/#style-rules).\\n3. Pass these two things to `stack_data.style_with_executing_node(style, modifier)` to get a new style class.\\n4. Pass the new style to your formatter when you create it.\\n\\nNote that this doesn't work with `TerminalFormatter` which just uses the basic ANSI colors and doesn't use the style passed to it in general.\\n\\n## Getting the full stack\\n\\nCurrently `print_stack()` doesn't actually print the stack, it just prints one frame. Instead of `frame_info = FrameInfo(frame, options)`, let's do this:\\n\\n```python\\nfor frame_info in FrameInfo.stack_data(frame, options):\\n```\\n\\nNow the output looks something like this:\\n\\n```\\n<module> at line 18\\n-----------\\n      14 |         for j in range(5):\\n      15 |             row.append(i * j)\\n      16 |     return result\\n-->   18 | bar()\\n\\nbar at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def bar():\\n-->    5 |     foo()\\n\\nfoo at line 13\\n-----------\\n      10 | for i in range(5):\\n      11 |     row = []\\n      12 |     result.append(row)\\n-->   13 |     print_stack()\\n      14 |     for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nHowever, just as `frame_info.lines` doesn't always yield `Line` objects, `FrameInfo.stack_data` doesn't always yield `FrameInfo` objects, and we must modify our code to handle that. Let's look at some different sample code:\\n\\n```python\\ndef factorial(x):\\n    return x * factorial(x - 1)\\n\\n\\ntry:\\n    print(factorial(5))\\nexcept:\\n    print_stack()\\n```\\n\\nIn this code we've forgotten to include a base case in our `factorial` function so it will fail with a `RecursionError` and there'll be many frames with similar information. Similar to the built in Python traceback, `stack_data` avoids showing all of these frames. Instead you will get a `RepeatedFrames` object which summarises the information. See its docstring for more details.\\n\\nHere is our updated implementation:\\n\\n```python\\ndef print_stack():\\n    for frame_info in FrameInfo.stack_data(sys.exc_info()[2]):\\n        if isinstance(frame_info, FrameInfo):\\n            print(f\\\"{frame_info.code.co_name} at line {frame_info.lineno}\\\")\\n            print(\\\"-----------\\\")\\n            for line in frame_info.lines:\\n                print(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render()}\\\")\\n\\n            for var in frame_info.variables:\\n                print(f\\\"{var.name} = {repr(var.value)}\\\")\\n\\n            print()\\n        else:\\n            print(f\\\"... {frame_info.description} ...\\\\n\\\")\\n```\\n\\nAnd the output:\\n\\n```\\n<module> at line 9\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n       5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\n       8 | try:\\n-->    9 |     print(factorial(5))\\n      10 | except:\\n\\nfactorial at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n-->    5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\nx = 5\\n\\nfactorial at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n-->    5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\nx = 4\\n\\n... factorial at line 5 (996 times) ...\\n\\nfactorial at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n-->    5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\nx = -993\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to handling repeated frames, we've passed a traceback object to `FrameInfo.stack_data` instead of a frame.\\n\\nIf you want, you can pass `collapse_repeated_frames=False` to `FrameInfo.stack_data` (not to `Options`) and it will just yield `FrameInfo` objects for the full stack.\\n\",\n",

Every time you stay there the\\nprice goes up by $50!\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @property\\n        def boardwalk(self):\\n            # In reality, this might represent a database call or time\\n            # intensive task like calling a third-party API.\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow run it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    600\\n\\nLet's convert the boardwalk property into a ``cached_property``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from cached_property import cached_property\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @cached_property\\n        def boardwalk(self):\\n            # Again, this is a silly example. Don't worry about it, this is\\n            #   just an example for clarity.\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow when we run it the price stays at $550.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n\\nWhy doesn't the value of ``monopoly.boardwalk`` change? Because it's a **cached property**!\\n\\nInvalidating the Cache\\n----------------------\\n\\nResults of cached functions can be invalidated by outside forces. Let's demonstrate how to force the cache to invalidate:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> # invalidate the cache\\n    >>> del monopoly.__dict__['boardwalk']\\n    >>> # request the boardwalk property again\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    600\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    600\\n\\nWorking with Threads\\n---------------------\\n\\nWhat if a whole bunch of people want to stay at Boardwalk all at once? This means using threads, which\\nunfortunately causes problems with the standard ``cached_property``. In this case, switch to using the\\n``threaded_cached_property``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from cached_property import threaded_cached_property\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @threaded_cached_property\\n        def boardwalk(self):\\n            \\\"\\\"\\\"threaded_cached_property is really nice for when no one waits\\n                for other people to finish their turn and rudely start rolling\\n                dice and moving their pieces.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n            sleep(1)\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow use it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from threading import Thread\\n    >>> from monopoly import Monopoly\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> threads = []\\n    >>> for x in range(10):\\n    >>>     thread = Thread(target=lambda: monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    >>>     thread.start()\\n    >>>     threads.append(thread)\\n\\n    >>> for thread in threads:\\n    >>>     thread.join()\\n\\n    >>> self.assertEqual(m.boardwalk, 550)\\n\\n\\nWorking with async/await (Python 3.5+)\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nThe cached property can be async, in which case you have to use await\\nas usual to get the value. Because of the caching, the value is only\\ncomputed once and then cached:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from cached_property import cached_property\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @cached_property\\n        async def boardwalk(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow use it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> async def print_boardwalk():\\n    ...     monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    ...     print(await monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    ...     print(await monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    ...     print(await monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    >>> import asyncio\\n    >>> asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(print_boardwalk())\\n    550\\n    550\\n    550\\n\\nNote that this does not work with threading either, most asyncio\\nobjects are not thread-safe. And if you run separate event loops in\\neach thread, the cached version will most likely have the wrong event\\nloop. To summarize, either use cooperative multitasking (event loop)\\nor threading, but not both at the same time.\\n\\n\\nTiming out the cache\\n--------------------\\n\\nSometimes you want the price of things to reset after a time. Use the ``ttl``\\nversions of ``cached_property`` and ``threaded_cached_property``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    import random\\n    from cached_property import cached_property_with_ttl\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        @cached_property_with_ttl(ttl=5) # cache invalidates after 5 seconds\\n        def dice(self):\\n            # I dare the reader to implement a game using this method of 'rolling dice'.\\n            return random.randint(2,12)\\n\\nNow use it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    10\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    10\\n    >>> from time import sleep\\n    >>> sleep(6) # Sleeps long enough to expire the cache\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    3\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    3\\n\\n**Note:** The ``ttl`` tools do not reliably allow the clearing of the cache. This\\nis why they are broken out into seperate tools.

The nbconvert tool allows you to convert an\\n`.ipynb` notebook file into various static formats including:\\n\\n- HTML\\n- LaTeX\\n- PDF\\n- Reveal JS\\n- Markdown (md)\\n- ReStructured Text (rst)\\n- executable script\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nFrom the command line, use nbconvert to convert a Jupyter notebook (_input_) to a\\na different format (_output_). The basic command structure is:\\n\\n```\\n$ jupyter nbconvert --to <output format> <input notebook>\\n```\\n\\nwhere `<output format>` is the desired output format and `<input notebook>` is the\\nfilename of the Jupyter notebook.\\n\\n### Example: Convert a notebook to HTML\\n\\nConvert Jupyter notebook file, `mynotebook.ipynb`, to HTML using:\\n\\n```\\n$ jupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb\\n```\\n\\nThis command creates an HTML output file named `mynotebook.html`.\\n\\n## Dev Install\\n\\nCheck if pandoc is installed (`pandoc --version`); if needed, install:\\n\\n```\\nsudo apt-get install pandoc\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```\\nbrew install pandoc\\n```\\n\\nInstall nbconvert for development using:\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert.git\\ncd nbconvert\\npip install -e .\\n```\\n\\nRunning the tests after a dev install above:\\n\\n```\\npip install nbconvert[test]\\npy.test --pyargs nbconvert\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n- [Documentation for Jupyter nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\\n- [nbconvert examples on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert-examples)\\n- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\\n\\n## Technical Support\\n\\n- [Issues and Bug Reports](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues): A place to report\\n  bugs or regressions found for nbconvert\\n- [Community Technical Support and Discussion - Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/): A place for\\n  installation, configuration, and troubleshooting assistannce by the Jupyter community.\\n  As a non-profit project and maintainers who are primarily volunteers, we encourage you\\n  to ask questions and share your knowledge on Discourse.\\n\\n## Jupyter Resources\\n\\n- [Jupyter mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter)\\n- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\\n\\n## About the Jupyter Development Team\\n\\nThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.\\nThis includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nJupyter uses a shared copyright model.

On OS X, it uses native ``FSMoveObjectToTrashSync`` Cocoa calls or can use pyobjc \\nwith NSFileManager. On Windows, it uses native ``IFileOperation`` call if on Vista or newer and \\npywin32 is installed or falls back to ``SHFileOperation`` calls. On other platforms, if `PyGObject`_ \\nand `GIO`_ are available, it will use this.  Otherwise, it will fallback to its own implementation of \\nthe `trash specifications from freedesktop.org`_.\\n\\n``ctypes`` is used to access native libraries, so no compilation is necessary.\\n\\nSend2Trash supports Python 2.7 and up (Python 3 is supported).\\n\\nStatus: Additional Help Welcome\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nAdditional help is welcome for supporting this package.  Specifically help with the OSX and Linux \\nissues and fixes would be most appreciated.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nYou can download it with pip:\\n\\n    python -m pip install -U send2trash\\n\\nTo install with pywin32 or pyobjc required specify the extra `nativeLib`:\\n\\n    python -m pip install -U send2trash[nativeLib]\\n\\nor you can download the source from http://github.com/arsenetar/send2trash and install it with::\\n\\n    >>> python setup.py install\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\n>>> from send2trash import send2trash\\n>>> send2trash('some_file')\\n>>> send2trash(['some_file1', 'some_file2'])\\n\\nOn Freedesktop platforms (Linux, BSD, etc.), you may not be able to efficiently\\ntrash some files. In these cases, an exception ``send2trash.TrashPermissionError``\\nis raised, so that the application can handle this case. This inherits from\\n``PermissionError`` (``OSError`` on Python 2). Specifically, this affects\\nfiles on a different device to the user's home directory, where the root of the\\ndevice does not have a ``.Trash`` directory, and we don't have permission to\\ncreate a ``.Trash-$UID`` directory.\\n\\nFor any other problem, ``OSError`` is raised.\\n\\n.. _PyGObject: https://wiki.gnome.org/PyGObject\\n.. _GIO: https://developer.gnome.org/gio/\\n.. _trash specifications from freedesktop.org: http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec/\\n\",\n",

Due to its modular design, you can extend (or even rewrite!)\\nthe complete list without changing the source code. It supports a lot of\\nnumpy mathematical operations **without monkey patching or wrapping numpy**.\\n\\nIt has a complete test coverage. It runs in Python 3.9+ with no other dependency.\\nIt is licensed under BSD.\\n\\nIt is extremely easy and natural to use:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import pint\\n    >>> ureg = pint.UnitRegistry()\\n    >>> 3 * ureg.meter + 4 * ureg.cm\\n    <Quantity(3.04, 'meter')>\\n\\nand you can make good use of numpy if you want:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> [3, 4] * ureg.meter + [4, 3] * ureg.cm\\n    <Quantity([ 3.04  4.03], 'meter')>\\n    >>> np.sum(_)\\n    <Quantity(7.07, 'meter')>\\n\\n\\nQuick Installation\\n------------------\\n\\nTo install Pint, simply:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ pip install pint\\n\\nor utilizing conda, with the conda-forge channel:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge pint\\n\\nand then simply enjoy it!\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nFull documentation is available at http://pint.readthedocs.org/\\n\\n\\nCommand-line converter\\n----------------------\\n\\nA command-line script `pint-convert` provides a quick way to convert between\\nunits or get conversion factors.\\n\\n\\nDesign principles\\n-----------------\\n\\nAlthough there are already a few very good Python packages to handle physical\\nquantities, no one was really fitting my needs. Like most developers, I\\nprogrammed Pint to scratch my own itches.\\n\\n**Unit parsing**: prefixed and pluralized forms of units are recognized without\\nexplicitly defining them. In other words: as the prefix *kilo* and the unit\\n*meter* are defined, Pint understands *kilometers*. This results in a much\\nshorter and maintainable unit definition list as compared to other packages.\\n\\n**Standalone unit definitions**: units definitions are loaded from a text file\\nwhich is simple and easy to edit. Adding and changing units and their\\ndefinitions does not involve changing the code.\\n\\n**Advanced string formatting**: a quantity can be formatted into string using\\n`PEP 3101`_ syntax. Extended conversion flags are given to provide symbolic,\\nLaTeX and pretty formatting. Unit name translation is available if Babel_ is\\ninstalled.\\n\\n**Free to choose the numerical type**: You can use any numerical type\\n(`fraction`, `float`, `decimal`, `numpy.ndarray`, etc). NumPy_ is not required\\nbut supported.\\n\\n**Awesome NumPy integration**: When you choose to use a NumPy_ ndarray, its methods and\\nufuncs are supported including automatic conversion of units. For example\\n`numpy.arccos(q)` will require a dimensionless `q` and the units of the output\\nquantity will be radian.\\n\\n**Uncertainties integration**:  transparently handles calculations with\\nquantities with uncertainties (like 3.14±0.01 meter) via the `uncertainties\\npackage`_.\\n\\n**Handle temperature**: conversion between units with different reference\\npoints, like positions on a map or absolute temperature scales.\\n\\n**Dependency free**: it depends only on Python and its standard library. It interacts with other packages\\nlike numpy and uncertainties if they are installed\\n\\n**Pandas integration**: Thanks to `Pandas Extension Types`_ it is now possible to use Pint with Pandas. Operations on DataFrames and between columns are units aware, providing even more convenience for users of Pandas DataFrames. For full details, see the `pint-pandas Jupyter notebook`_.\\n\\n\\nPint is maintained by a community of scientists, programmers and enthusiasts around the world.\\nSee AUTHORS_ for a complete list.\\n\\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\\nsee CHANGES_\\n\\n\\n.. _Website: http://www.dimensionalanalysis.org/\\n.. _`comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes and constants`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt\\n.. _`uncertainties package`: https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\\n.. _`NumPy`: http://www.numpy.org/\\n.. _`PEP 3101`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/\\n.. _`Babel`: http://babel.pocoo.org/\\n.. _`Pandas Extension Types`: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html#extension-types\\n.. _`pint-pandas Jupyter notebook`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint-pandas/blob/master/notebooks/pint-pandas.ipynb\\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/AUTHORS\\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/CHANGES\\n\",\n",

This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network\\nAPI, and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded,\\nasynchronous, or your own implementation of `RFC 6214\\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6214>`_ -- h11 won't judge you.\\n(Compare this to the current state of the art, where every time a `new\\nnetwork API <https://trio.readthedocs.io/>`_ comes along then someone\\ngets to start over reimplementing the entire HTTP protocol from\\nscratch.) Cory Benfield made an `excellent blog post describing the\\nbenefits of this approach\\n<https://lukasa.co.uk/2015/10/The_New_Hyper/>`_, or if you like video\\nthen here's his `PyCon 2016 talk on the same theme\\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cC3_jGwl_U>`_.\\n\\nThis also means that h11 is not immediately useful out of the box:\\nit's a toolkit for building programs that speak HTTP, not something\\nthat could directly replace ``requests`` or ``twisted.web`` or\\nwhatever. But h11 makes it much easier to implement something like\\n``requests`` or ``twisted.web``.\\n\\nAt a high level, working with h11 goes like this:\\n\\n1) First, create an ``h11.Connection`` object to track the state of a\\n   single HTTP/1.1 connection.\\n\\n2) When you read data off the network, pass it to\\n   ``conn.receive_data(...)``; you'll get back a list of objects\\n   representing high-level HTTP \\\"events\\\".\\n\\n3) When you want to send a high-level HTTP event, create the\\n   corresponding \\\"event\\\" object and pass it to ``conn.send(...)``;\\n   this will give you back some bytes that you can then push out\\n   through the network.\\n\\nFor example, a client might instantiate and then send a\\n``h11.Request`` object, then zero or more ``h11.Data`` objects for the\\nrequest body (e.g., if this is a POST), and then a\\n``h11.EndOfMessage`` to indicate the end of the message. Then the\\nserver would then send back a ``h11.Response``, some ``h11.Data``, and\\nits own ``h11.EndOfMessage``. If either side violates the protocol,\\nyou'll get a ``h11.ProtocolError`` exception.\\n\\nh11 is suitable for implementing both servers and clients, and has a\\npleasantly symmetric API: the events you send as a client are exactly\\nthe ones that you receive as a server and vice-versa.\\n\\n`Here's an example of a tiny HTTP client\\n<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/examples/basic-client.py>`_\\n\\nIt also has `a fine manual <https://h11.readthedocs.io/>`_.\\n\\nFAQ\\n---\\n\\n*Whyyyyy?*\\n\\nI wanted to play with HTTP in `Curio\\n<https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`__ and `Trio\\n<https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__, which at the time didn't have any\\nHTTP libraries. So I thought, no big deal, Python has, like, a dozen\\ndifferent implementations of HTTP, surely I can find one that's\\nreusable. I didn't find one, but I did find Cory's call-to-arms\\nblog-post. So I figured, well, fine, if I have to implement HTTP from\\nscratch, at least I can make sure no-one *else* has to ever again.\\n\\n*Should I use it?*\\n\\nMaybe. You should be aware that it's a very young project. But, it's\\nfeature complete and has an exhaustive test-suite and complete docs,\\nso the next step is for people to try using it and see how it goes\\n:-). If you do then please let us know -- if nothing else we'll want\\nto talk to you before making any incompatible changes!\\n\\n*What are the features/limitations?*\\n\\nRoughly speaking, it's trying to be a robust, complete, and non-hacky\\nimplementation of the first \\\"chapter\\\" of the HTTP/1.1 spec: `RFC 7230:\\nHTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing\\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230>`_. That is, it mostly focuses on\\nimplementing HTTP at the level of taking bytes on and off the wire,\\nand the headers related to that, and tries to be anal about spec\\nconformance. It doesn't know about higher-level concerns like URL\\nrouting, conditional GETs, cross-origin cookie policies, or content\\nnegotiation. But it does know how to take care of framing,\\ncross-version differences in keep-alive handling, and the \\\"obsolete\\nline folding\\\" rule, so you can focus your energies on the hard /\\ninteresting parts for your application, and it tries to support the\\nfull specification in the sense that any useful HTTP/1.1 conformant\\napplication should be able to use h11.\\n\\nIt's pure Python, and has no dependencies outside of the standard\\nlibrary.\\n\\nIt has a test suite with 100.0% coverage for both statements and\\nbranches.\\n\\nCurrently it supports Python 3 (testing on 3.8-3.12) and PyPy 3.\\nThe last Python 2-compatible version was h11 0.11.x.\\n(Originally it had a Cython wrapper for `http-parser\\n<https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser>`_ and a beautiful nested state\\nmachine implemented with ``yield from`` to postprocess the output. But\\nI had to take these out -- the new *parser* needs fewer lines-of-code\\nthan the old *parser wrapper*, is written in pure Python, uses no\\nexotic language syntax, and has more features. It's sad, really; that\\nold state machine was really slick. I just need a few sentences here\\nto mourn that.)\\n\\nI don't know how fast it is. I haven't benchmarked or profiled it yet,\\nso it's probably got a few pointless hot spots, and I've been trying\\nto err on the side of simplicity and robustness instead of\\nmicro-optimization. But at the architectural level I tried hard to\\navoid fundamentally bad decisions, e.g., I believe that all the\\nparsing algorithms remain linear-time even in the face of pathological\\ninput like slowloris, and there are no byte-by-byte loops. (I also\\nbelieve that it maintains bounded memory usage in the face of\\narbitrary/pathological input.)\\n\\nThe whole library is ~800 lines-of-code. You can read and understand\\nthe whole thing in less than an hour. Most of the energy invested in\\nthis so far has been spent on trying to keep things simple by\\nminimizing special-cases and ad hoc state manipulation; even though it\\nis now quite small and simple, I'm still annoyed that I haven't\\nfigured out how to make it even smaller and simpler. (Unfortunately,\\nHTTP does not lend itself to simplicity.)\\n\\nThe API is ~feature complete and I don't expect the general outlines\\nto change much, but you can't judge an API's ergonomics until you\\nactually document and use it, so I'd expect some changes in the\\ndetails.\\n\\n*How do I try it?*\\n\\n.. code-block:: sh\\n\\n  $ pip install h11\\n  $ git clone git@github.com:python-hyper/h11\\n  $ cd h11/examples\\n  $ python basic-client.py\\n\\nand go from there.\\n\\n*License?*\\n\\nMIT\\n\\n*Code of conduct?*\\n\\nContributors are requested to follow our `code of conduct\\n<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ in\\nall project spaces.\\n\",\n",

<https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/HISTORY.rst>`_\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n=======\\n\\npsutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for\\nretrieving information on **running processes** and **system utilization**\\n(CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.\\nIt is useful mainly for **system monitoring**, **profiling and limiting process\\nresources** and **management of running processes**.\\nIt implements many functionalities offered by classic UNIX command line tools\\nsuch as *ps, top, iotop, lsof, netstat, ifconfig, free* and others.\\npsutil currently supports the following platforms:\\n\\n- **Linux**\\n- **Windows**\\n- **macOS**\\n- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD**, **NetBSD**\\n- **Sun Solaris**\\n- **AIX**\\n\\nSupported Python versions are cPython 3.6+ and `PyPy <https://pypy.org/>`__.\\nLatest psutil version supporting Python 2.7 is\\n`psutil 6.1.1 <https://pypi.org/project/psutil/6.1.1/>`__.\\n\\nFunding\\n=======\\n\\nWhile psutil is free software and will always be, the project would benefit\\nimmensely from some funding.\\nKeeping up with bug reports and maintenance has become hardly sustainable for\\nme alone in terms of time.\\nIf you're a company that's making significant use of psutil you can consider\\nbecoming a sponsor via `GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors/giampaolo>`__,\\n`Open Collective <https://opencollective.com/psutil>`__ or\\n`PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9ZS7PKKRM3S8>`__\\nand have your logo displayed in here and psutil `doc

Only the\\nhigh-level API is bound.\\n\\nDocumentation available at: http://freetype-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n**From PyPI, recommended**: `pip install freetype-py`. This will install the\\nlibrary with a bundled FreeType binary, so you're ready to go on Windows,\\nmacOS and Linux (all with 32 and 64 bit x86 architecture support).\\n\\nDo note: if you specify the `--no-binary` paramater to pip, or use a different\\narchitecture for which we don't pre-compile binaries, the package will default\\nto using an external FreeType library. Specify the environment variable\\n`FREETYPEPY_BUNDLE_FT=1` before calling pip to compile a binary yourself.\\n\\nInstallation with compiling FreeType from source\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you don't want to or can't use the pre-built binaries, build FreeType\\nyourself: `export FREETYPEPY_BUNDLE_FT=yesplease && pip install .`.\\nThis will download and compile FreeType with Harfbuzz support as specified in\\n`setup-build-freetype.py`. Set the environment variable `PYTHON_ARCH` to 32 or\\n64 to explicitly set an architecture, default is whatever your host machine\\nuses. On macOS, we will always build a universal 32 and 64 bit Intel binary.\\n\\n- Windows: You need CMake and a C and C++ compiler, e.g. the Visual Code\\n  Community 2017 distribution with the desktop C++ workload.\\n- macOS: You need CMake and the XCode tools (full IDE not necessary)\\n- Linux: You need CMake, gcc and g++. For building a 32 bit library on a\\n  64 bit machine, you need gcc-multilib and g++-multilib (Debian) or\\n  glibc-devel.i686 and libstdc++-devel.i686 (Fedora).\\n\\nInstallation with an external FreeType library (the default)\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nInstall just the pure Python library and let it find a system-wide installed\\nFreeType at runtime.\\n\\nMac users\\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFreetype should be already installed on your system. If not, either install it\\nusing `homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ or compile it and place the library binary\\nfile in '/usr/local/lib'.\\n\\nLinux users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFreetype should be already installed on your system. If not, either install\\nrelevant package from your package manager or compile from sources and place\\nthe library binary file in '/usr/local/lib'.\\n\\nWindow users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThere are no official Freetype binary releases available, but they offer some\\nlinks to precompiled Windows DLLs. Please see the `FreeType Downloads\\n<https://www.freetype.org/download.html>`_ page for links.\\nYou can also compile the FreeType library from source yourself.\\n\\nIf you are using freetype-py on Windows with a 32-Bit version of Python, you\\nneed the 32-Bit version of the Freetype binary. The same applies for a 64-Bit\\nversion of Python.\\n\\nBecause of the way Windows searches for dll files, make sure the resulting\\nfile is named 'freetype.dll' (and not something like Freetype245.dll).\\nWindows expects the library in one of the directories listed in the $PATH\\nenvironment variable. As it is not recommended to place the dll in a Windows\\nsystem folder, you can choose one of the following ways to solve this:\\n\\n* Place library in a folder of your choice and edit the $PATH user\\n  environment variable\\n* Place library in a folder of your choice and edit the $PATH system\\n  environment variable\\n* For development purpose, place the library in the working directory of\\n  the application\\n* Place the library in one of the existing directories listed in $PATH\\n\\nTo get a complete list of all the directories in the $PATH\\nenvironment variable (user and system), open a command promt and type\\n\\n.. code::\\n\\n   echo %PATH%\\n\\nUsage example\\n=============\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n   import freetype\\n   face = freetype.Face(\\\"Vera.ttf\\\")\\n   face.set_char_size( 48*64 )\\n   face.load_char('S')\\n   bitmap = face.glyph.bitmap\\n   print(bitmap.buffer)\\n\\nScreenshots\\n===========\\n\\nScreenshot below comes from the wordle.py example. No clever tricks here, just\\nbrute force.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/wordle.png\\n\\nScreenshots below comes from the glyph-vector.py and glyph-vector-2.py\\nexamples showing how to access a glyph outline information and use it to draw\\nthe glyph. Rendering (with Bézier curves) is done using matplotlib.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/S.png\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/G.png\\n\\n\\nScreenshot below comes from the glyph-color.py showing how to draw and combine\\na glyph outline with the regular glyph.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/outline.png\\n\\nThe screenshot below comes from the hello-world.py example showing how to draw\\ntext in a bitmap (that has been zoomed in to show antialiasing).\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/hello-world.png\\n\\n\\nThe screenshot below comes from the agg-trick.py example showing an\\nimplementation of ideas from the `Texts Rasterization Exposures\\n<http://agg.sourceforge.net/antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/>`_ by\\nMaxim Shemarev.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/agg-trick.png\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

SQLAlchemy provides a full suite\\nof well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,\\ndesigned for efficient and high-performing database\\naccess, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain\\nlanguage.\\n\\nMajor SQLAlchemy features include:\\n\\n* An industrial strength ORM, built\\n  from the core on the identity map, unit of work,\\n  and data mapper patterns.   These patterns\\n  allow transparent persistence of objects\\n  using a declarative configuration system.\\n  Domain models\\n  can be constructed and manipulated naturally,\\n  and changes are synchronized with the\\n  current transaction automatically.\\n* A relationally-oriented query system, exposing\\n  the full range of SQL's capabilities\\n  explicitly, including joins, subqueries,\\n  correlation, and most everything else,\\n  in terms of the object model.\\n  Writing queries with the ORM uses the same\\n  techniques of relational composition you use\\n  when writing SQL.  While you can drop into\\n  literal SQL at any time, it's virtually never\\n  needed.\\n* A comprehensive and flexible system\\n  of eager loading for related collections and objects.\\n  Collections are cached within a session,\\n  and can be loaded on individual access, all\\n  at once using joins, or by query per collection\\n  across the full result set.\\n* A Core SQL construction system and DBAPI\\n  interaction layer.  The SQLAlchemy Core is\\n  separate from the ORM and is a full database\\n  abstraction layer in its own right, and includes\\n  an extensible Python-based SQL expression\\n  language, schema metadata, connection pooling,\\n  type coercion, and custom types.\\n* All primary and foreign key constraints are\\n  assumed to be composite and natural.  Surrogate\\n  integer primary keys are of course still the\\n  norm, but SQLAlchemy never assumes or hardcodes\\n  to this model.\\n* Database introspection and generation.  Database\\n  schemas can be \\\"reflected\\\" in one step into\\n  Python structures representing database metadata;\\n  those same structures can then generate\\n  CREATE statements right back out - all within\\n  the Core, independent of the ORM.\\n\\nSQLAlchemy's philosophy:\\n\\n* SQL databases behave less and less like object\\n  collections the more size and performance start to\\n  matter; object collections behave less and less like\\n  tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.\\n  SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate both of these\\n  principles.\\n* An ORM doesn't need to hide the \\\"R\\\".   A relational\\n  database provides rich, set-based functionality\\n  that should be fully exposed.   SQLAlchemy's\\n  ORM provides an open-ended set of patterns\\n  that allow a developer to construct a custom\\n  mediation layer between a domain model and\\n  a relational schema, turning the so-called\\n  \\\"object relational impedance\\\" issue into\\n  a distant memory.\\n* The developer, in all cases, makes all decisions\\n  regarding the design, structure, and naming conventions\\n  of both the object model as well as the relational\\n  schema.   SQLAlchemy only provides the means\\n  to automate the execution of these decisions.\\n* With SQLAlchemy, there's no such thing as\\n  \\\"the ORM generated a bad query\\\" - you\\n  retain full control over the structure of\\n  queries, including how joins are organized,\\n  how subqueries and correlation is used, what\\n  columns are requested.  Everything SQLAlchemy\\n  does is ultimately the result of a developer-initiated \\n  decision.\\n* Don't use an ORM if the problem doesn't need one.\\n  SQLAlchemy consists of a Core and separate ORM\\n  component.   The Core offers a full SQL expression\\n  language that allows Pythonic construction\\n  of SQL constructs that render directly to SQL\\n  strings for a target database, returning\\n  result sets that are essentially enhanced DBAPI\\n  cursors.\\n* Transactions should be the norm.  With SQLAlchemy's\\n  ORM, nothing goes to permanent storage until\\n  commit() is called.  SQLAlchemy encourages applications\\n  to create a consistent means of delineating\\n  the start and end of a series of operations.\\n* Never render a literal value in a SQL statement.\\n  Bound parameters are used to the greatest degree\\n  possible, allowing query optimizers to cache\\n  query plans effectively and making SQL injection\\n  attacks a non-issue.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nLatest documentation is at:\\n\\nhttps://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/\\n\\nInstallation / Requirements\\n---------------------------\\n\\nFull documentation for installation is at\\n`Installation <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/intro.html#installation>`_.\\n\\nGetting Help / Development / Bug reporting\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nPlease refer to the `SQLAlchemy Community Guide <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html>`_.\\n\\nCode of Conduct\\n---------------\\n\\nAbove all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\\nPlease see our current Code of Conduct at\\n`Code of Conduct <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\nSQLAlchemy is distributed under the `MIT license\\n<https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.\\n\\n\",\n",

Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\\n* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\\n* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\\n  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\\n  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\\n  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\\n  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\\n  and Windows registry-based time zones.\\n* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\\n  Olson's database.\\n* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\\n  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\\n* A comprehensive test suite.\\n\\nQuick example\\n=============\\nHere's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\\npackage. For more examples, look at the documentation.\\n\\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\\ndate out of the \\\"date\\\" unix system command. Here is the code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python3\\n\\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\\n    >>> from datetime import *\\n    >>> now = parse(\\\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\\\")\\n    >>> today = now.date()\\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\\n    >>> print(\\\"Today is: %s\\\" % today)\\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\\n    >>> print(\\\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\\\" % year)\\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\\n    >>> print(\\\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\\\" % rdelta)\\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\\n    >>> print(\\\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\\\" % (today+rdelta))\\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\\n\\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\\n\\nContributing\\n============\\n\\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).

status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/openforcefield/openff-units/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/openforcefield/openff-units/main)\\n[![conda](https://img.shields.io/conda/v/conda-forge/openff-units.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openff-units)\\n\\n\\nA common units module for the OpenFF software stack\\n\\n**Please note that there may still be some changes to the API prior to a stable 1.0.0 release.**\\n\\nThis package provides a common unit registry for all OpenFF packages to use in order to ensure consistent unit definitions across the software ecosystem.\\n\\nThe unit definitions are currently sourced from the NIST 2018 [CODATA](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/), but may be updated in future versions as new CODATA updates are made.\\n\\nWhile this repository is based on [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.16.1/), the main classes (`Unit`, `Quantity`, and `Measurement`) have been slightly modified in order to provide non-dynamic, more readily serialisable representations.\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nInstall via `conda` or a replacement:\\n\\n```shell\\nconda install openff-units -c conda-forge\\n```\\n\\n### Getting Started\\n\\nBelow shows how to tag a number with a unit (generating a `Quantity` object),\\nget its magnitude with and without units, convert to another unit, and also get its magnitude after converting to another unit.\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openff.units import unit\\n>>> bond_length = 1.4 * unit.angstrom\\n>>> bond_length\\n<Quantity(1.4, 'angstrom')>\\n>>> bond_length.magnitude\\n1.4\\n>>> bond_length.to(unit.nanometer)\\n<Quantity(0.14, 'nanometer')>\\n>>> bond_length.magnitude_as(unit.nanometer)\\n0.14\\n```\\n\\nOne could also do the [Pint tutorial](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.16.1/tutorial.html#tutorial) using the `unit` object above as a drop-in replacement for `ureg` in the tutorial.\\n\\n### Serialization\\n\\nScalar quantities can be serialized to strings using the built-in `str()` function and deserialized using the `unit.Quantity` constructor.\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> k = 10 * unit.kilocalorie / unit.mol / unit.nanometer**2\\n>>> k\\n<Quantity(10.0, 'kilocalorie / mole / nanometer ** 2')>\\n>>> str(k)\\n'10.0 kcal / mol / nm ** 2'\\n>>> unit.Quantity(str(k))\\n<Quantity(10.0, 'kilocalorie / mole / nanometer ** 2')>\\n```\\n\\n### OpenMM Interoperability\\n\\nFor compatibility with [OpenMM units](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/app.html#units), a submodule (`openff.units.openmm`) with conversion functions (`to_openmm`, `from_openmm`) is also provided.\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openff.units import unit\\n>>> from openff.units.openmm import to_openmm, from_openmm\\n>>> distance = 24.0 * unit.meter\\n>>> converted = to_openmm(distance)\\n>>> converted\\nQuantity(value=24.0, unit=meter)\\n>>> type(converted)\\n<class 'openmm.unit.quantity.Quantity'>\\n>>> roundtripped = from_openmm(converted)\\n>>> roundtripped\\n<Quantity(24.0, 'meter')>\\n>>> type(roundtripped)\\n<class 'openff.units.units.Quantity'>\\n```\\n\\nAn effort is made to convert from OpenMM constructs, such as when OpenMM provides array-like data as a list of `Vec3` objects:into Pint's wrapped NumPy arrays:\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openmm import app\\n>>> positions = app.PDBFile(\\\"top.pdb\\\").getPositions()\\n>>> positions\\nQuantity(value=[Vec3(x=-0.07890000000000001, y=-0.0198, z=-0.0), Vec3(x=-0.0006000000000000001, y=0.039200000000000006, z=-0.0), Vec3(x=0.07950000000000002, y=-0.0194, z=0.0), Vec3(x=0.9211, y=0.9802, z=1.0), Vec3(x=0.9994000000000001, y=1.0392, z=1.0), Vec3(x=1.0795000000000001, y=0.9805999999999999, z=1.0)], unit=nanometer)\\n>>> type(positions)\\n<class 'openmm.unit.quantity.Quantity'>\\n>>> type(positions._value)\\n<class 'list'>\\n>>> type(positions._value[0])\\n<class 'openmm.vec3.Vec3'>\\n>>> converted = from_openmm(positions)\\n>>> converted\\n<Quantity([[-7.8900e-02 -1.9800e-02 -0.0000e+00]\\n [-6.0000e-04  3.9200e-02 -0.0000e+00]\\n [ 7.9500e-02 -1.9400e-02  0.0000e+00]\\n [ 9.2110e-01  9.8020e-01  1.0000e+00]\\n [ 9.9940e-01  1.0392e+00  1.0000e+00]\\n [ 1.0795e+00  9.8060e-01  1.0000e+00]], 'nanometer')>\\n>>> converted.m\\narray([[-7.8900e-02, -1.9800e-02, -0.0000e+00],\\n

packages\\n\\nYou may find yourself needing to normalize a quantity to a particular unit package, while accepting inputs from either `openff.units` or `openmm.unit`. The [`ensure_quantity`] function simplifies this. It takes as arguments a quantity object from either unit solution and a string (`\\\"openff\\\"` or `\\\"openmm\\\"`) indicating the desired unit type, and returns a quantity from that package. If the quantity argument is already the requested type, the function short-circuits, so it should not introduce substantial overhead compared to simply requiring the target quantity type.\\n\\n[`ensure_quantity`]: https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/units/en/stable/api/generated/openff.units.ensure_quantity.html\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openff.units import unit, ensure_quantity\\n>>> ensure_quantity(unit.Quantity(4.0, unit.angstrom), \\\"openff\\\")\\n<Quantity(4.0, 'angstrom')>  # OpenFF\\n>>> ensure_quantity(unit.Quantity(4.0, unit.angstrom), \\\"openmm\\\")\\nQuantity(value=4.0, unit=angstrom)  # OpenMM\\n>>>\\n>>> import openmm.unit\\n>>> ensure_quantity(openmm.unit.Quantity(4.0, openmm.unit.angstrom), \\\"openmm\\\")\\nQuantity(value=4.0, unit=angstrom)  # OpenMM\\n>>> ensure_quantity(openmm.unit.Quantity(4.0, openmm.unit.angstrom), \\\"openff\\\")\\n<Quantity(4.0, 'angstrom')>  # OpenFF\\n```\\n\\n### Known issues\\n\\nThere is a quirk with cached unit registry definitions that can cause issues when running tests in parallel (i.e. with `pytest-xdist`). See [Issue #111](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-units/issues/111) for more details.\\n\\n### Copyright\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2021, Open Force Field Initiative\\n\\n\\n#### Acknowledgements\\n \\nProject based on the \\n[Computational Molecular Science Python Cookiecutter](https://github.com/molssi/cookiecutter-cms) version 1.5.\\n\",\n",

However,\\nthere are categories of characters that *occupy 2 cells* (full-wide), and\\nothers that *occupy 0* cells (zero-width).\\n\\n**Solution**: POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 conforming systems provide\\n`wcwidth(3)`_ and `wcswidth(3)`_ C functions of which this python module's\\nfunctions precisely copy.  *These functions return the number of cells a\\nunicode string is expected to occupy.*\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nThe stable version of this package is maintained on pypi, install using pip::\\n\\n    pip install wcwidth\\n\\nExample\\n-------\\n\\n**Problem**: given the following phrase (Japanese),\\n\\n   >>>  text = u'コンニチハ'\\n\\nPython **incorrectly** uses the *string length* of 5 codepoints rather than the\\n*printable length* of 10 cells, so that when using the `rjust` function, the\\noutput length is wrong::\\n\\n    >>> print(len('コンニチハ'))\\n    5\\n\\n    >>> print('コンニチハ'.rjust(20, '_'))\\n    _______________コンニチハ\\n\\nBy defining our own \\\"rjust\\\" function that uses wcwidth, we can correct this::\\n\\n   >>> def wc_rjust(text, length, padding=' '):\\n   ...    from wcwidth import wcswidth\\n   ...    return padding * max(0, (length - wcswidth(text))) + text\\n   ...\\n\\nOur **Solution** uses wcswidth to determine the string length correctly::\\n\\n   >>> from wcwidth import wcswidth\\n   >>> print(wcswidth('コンニチハ'))\\n   10\\n\\n   >>> print(wc_rjust('コンニチハ', 20, '_'))\\n   __________コンニチハ\\n\\n\\nChoosing a Version\\n------------------\\n\\nExport an environment variable, ``UNICODE_VERSION``. This should be done by\\n*terminal emulators* or those developers experimenting with authoring one of\\ntheir own, from shell::\\n\\n   $ export UNICODE_VERSION=13.0\\n\\nIf unspecified, the latest version is used. If your Terminal Emulator does not\\nexport this variable, you can use the `jquast/ucs-detect`_ utility to\\nautomatically detect and export it to your shell.\\n\\nwcwidth, wcswidth\\n-----------------\\nUse function ``wcwidth()`` to determine the length of a *single unicode\\ncharacter*, and ``wcswidth()`` to determine the length of many, a *string\\nof unicode characters*.\\n\\nBriefly, return values of function ``wcwidth()`` are:\\n\\n``-1``\\n  Indeterminate (not printable).\\n\\n``0``\\n  Does not advance the cursor, such as NULL or Combining.\\n\\n``2``\\n  Characters of category East Asian Wide (W) or East Asian\\n  Full-width (F) which are displayed using two terminal cells.\\n\\n``1``\\n  All others.\\n\\nFunction ``wcswidth()`` simply returns the sum of all values for each character\\nalong a string, or ``-1`` when it occurs anywhere along a string.\\n\\nFull API Documentation at https://wcwidth.readthedocs.org\\n\\n==========\\nDeveloping\\n==========\\n\\nInstall wcwidth in editable mode::\\n\\n   pip install -e .\\n\\nExecute unit tests using tox_::\\n\\n   tox -e py27,py35,py36,py37,py38,py39,py310,py311,py312\\n\\nUpdating Unicode Version\\n------------------------\\n\\nRegenerate python code tables from latest Unicode Specification data files::\\n\\n   tox -e update\\n\\nThe script is located at ``bin/update-tables.py``, requires Python 3.9 or\\nlater. It is recommended but not necessary to run this script with the newest\\nPython, because the newest Python has the latest ``unicodedata`` for generating\\ncomments.\\n\\nBuilding Documentation\\n----------------------\\n\\nThis project is using `sphinx`_ 4.5 to build documentation::\\n\\n   tox -e sphinx\\n\\nThe output will be in ``docs/_build/html/``.\\n\\nUpdating Requirements\\n---------------------\\n\\nThis project is using `pip-tools`_ to manage requirements.\\n\\nTo upgrade requirements for updating unicode version, run::\\n\\n   tox -e update_requirements_update\\n\\nTo upgrade requirements for testing, run::\\n\\n   tox -e update_requirements37,update_requirements39\\n\\nTo upgrade requirements for building documentation, run::\\n\\n   tox -e update_requirements_docs\\n\\nUtilities\\n---------\\n\\nSupplementary tools for browsing and testing terminals for wide unicode\\ncharacters are found in the `bin/`_ of this project's source code.

(For instance, with a Pygments lexer.)\\n- Multi-line input editing.\\n- Advanced code completion.\\n- Both Emacs and Vi key bindings. (Similar to readline.)\\n- Even some advanced Vi functionality, like named registers and digraphs.\\n- Reverse and forward incremental search.\\n- Works well with Unicode double width characters. (Chinese input.)\\n- Selecting text for copy/paste. (Both Emacs and Vi style.)\\n- Support for `bracketed paste <https://cirw.in/blog/bracketed-paste>`_.\\n- Mouse support for cursor positioning and scrolling.\\n- Auto suggestions. (Like `fish shell <http://fishshell.com/>`_.)\\n- Multiple input buffers.\\n- No global state.\\n- Lightweight, the only dependencies are Pygments and wcwidth.\\n- Runs on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Windows systems.\\n- And much more...\\n\\nFeel free to create tickets for bugs and feature requests, and create pull\\nrequests if you have nice patches that you would like to share with others.\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n************\\n\\n::\\n\\n    pip install prompt_toolkit\\n\\nFor Conda, do:\\n\\n::\\n\\n    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge prompt_toolkit\\n\\n\\nAbout Windows support\\n*********************\\n\\n``prompt_toolkit`` is cross platform, and everything that you build on top\\nshould run fine on both Unix and Windows systems. Windows support is best on\\nrecent Windows 10 builds, for which the command line window supports vt100\\nescape sequences. (If not supported, we fall back to using Win32 APIs for color\\nand cursor movements).\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the implementation is a \\\"best effort of what is\\npossible\\\". Both Unix and Windows terminals have their limitations. But in\\ngeneral, the Unix experience will still be a little better.\\n\\n\\nGetting started\\n***************\\n\\nThe most simple example of the library would look like this:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from prompt_toolkit import prompt\\n\\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\\n        answer = prompt('Give me some input: ')\\n        print('You said: %s' % answer)\\n\\nFor more complex examples, have a look in the ``examples`` directory. All\\nexamples are chosen to demonstrate only one thing. Also, don't be afraid to\\nlook at the source code. The implementation of the ``prompt`` function could be\\na good start.\\n\\nPhilosophy\\n**********\\n\\nThe source code of ``prompt_toolkit`` should be **readable**, **concise** and\\n**efficient**. We prefer short functions focusing each on one task and for which\\nthe input and output types are clearly specified. We mostly prefer composition\\nover inheritance, because inheritance can result in too much functionality in\\nthe same object. We prefer immutable objects where possible (objects don't\\nchange after initialization). Reusability is important. We absolutely refrain\\nfrom having a changing global state, it should be possible to have multiple\\nindependent instances of the same code in the same process. The architecture\\nshould be layered: the lower levels operate on primitive operations and data\\nstructures giving -- when correctly combined -- all the possible flexibility;\\nwhile at the higher level, there should be a simpler API, ready-to-use and\\nsufficient for most use cases. Thinking about algorithms and efficiency is\\nimportant, but avoid premature optimization.\\n\\n\\n`Projects using prompt_toolkit <PROJECTS.rst>`_\\n***********************************************\\n\\nSpecial thanks to\\n*****************\\n\\n- `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_: Syntax highlighter.\\n- `wcwidth <https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth>`_: Determine columns needed for a wide characters.\\n\\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/prompt_toolkit.svg\\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prompt-toolkit/\\n    :alt: Latest Version\\n\\n.. |AppVeyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/32r7s2skrgm9ubva?svg=true\\n    :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/\\n\\n.. |RTD| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-prompt-toolkit/badge/\\n    :target: https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/\\n\\n.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit.svg\\n    :target: https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/LICENSE\\n\\n.. |Codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg?style=flat\\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/\\n\\n\",\n",

I have asked myself the same question while\\nworking on this project. It is clear that there are excellent parsers out\\nthere but I wanted to experiment with another way of writing them.\\n\\nThe idea is quite simple. You write a class for every type of content\\n(called here ``ParsedStatement``) you need to parse. Each class should\\nhave a ``from_string`` constructor. We used extensively the ``typing``\\nmodule to make the output structure easy to use and less error prone.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\n    import flexparser as fp\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Assigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            lhs, rhs = s.split(\\\"<-\\\")\\n            return cls(lhs.strip(), rhs.strip())\\n\\n(using a frozen dataclass is not necessary but it convenient. Being a\\ndataclass you get the init, str, repr, etc for free. Being frozen, sort\\nof immutable, makes them easier to reason around)\\n\\nIn certain cases you might want to signal the parser\\nthat his class is not appropriate to parse the statement.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Assigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            if \\\"<-\\\" not in s:\\n                # This means: I do not know how to parse it\\n                # try with another ParsedStatement class.\\n                return None\\n            lhs, rhs = s.split(\\\"<-\\\")\\n            return cls(lhs.strip(), rhs.strip())\\n\\n\\nYou might also want to indicate that this is the right ``ParsedStatement``\\nbut something is not right:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class InvalidIdentifier(fp.ParsingError):\\n        value: str\\n\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Assigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            if \\\"<-\\\" not in s:\\n                # This means: I do not know how to parse it\\n                # try with another ParsedStatement class.\\n                return None\\n            lhs, rhs = (p.strip() for p in s.split(\\\"<-\\\"))\\n\\n            if not str.isidentifier(lhs):\\n                return InvalidIdentifier(lhs)\\n\\n            return cls(lhs, rhs)\\n\\n\\nPut this into ``source.txt``\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    one <- other\\n    2two <- new\\n    three <- newvalue\\n    one == three\\n\\nand then run the following code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    parsed = fp.parse(\\\"source.txt\\\", Assigment)\\n    for el in parsed.iter_statements():\\n        print(repr(el))\\n\\nwill produce the following output:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    BOF(start_line=0, start_col=0, end_line=0, end_col=0, raw=None, content_hash=Hash(algorithm_name='blake2b', hexdigest='37bc23cde7cad3ece96b7abf64906c84decc116de1e0486679eb6ca696f233a403f756e2e431063c82abed4f0e342294c2fe71af69111faea3765b78cb90c03f'), path=PosixPath('/Users/grecco/Documents/code/flexparser/examples/in_readme/source1.txt'), mtime=1658550284.9419456)\\n    Assigment(start_line=1, start_col=0, end_line=1, end_col=12, raw='one <- other', lhs='one', rhs='other')\\n    InvalidIdentifier(start_line=2, start_col=0, end_line=2, end_col=11, raw='2two <- new', value='2two')\\n    Assigment(start_line=3, start_col=0, end_line=3, end_col=17, raw='three <- newvalue', lhs='three', rhs='newvalue')\\n    UnknownStatement(start_line=4, start_col=0, end_line=4, end_col=12, raw='one == three')\\n    EOS(start_line=5, start_col=0, end_line=5, end_col=0, raw=None)\\n\\n\\nThe result is a collection of ``ParsedStatement`` or ``ParsingError`` (flanked by\\n``BOF`` and ``EOS`` indicating beginning of file and ending of stream respectively\\nAlternative, it can beginning with ``BOR`` with means beginning of resource and it\\nis used when parsing a Python Resource provided with a package).\\n\\nNotice that there are two correctly parsed statements (``Assigment``), one\\nerror found (``InvalidIdentifier``) and one unknown (``UnknownStatement``).\\n\\nCool, right?

It is a thin wrapper\\nover a dictionary mapping files to parsed content. Because we have provided a single file\\nand this does not contain a link another, our ``parsed`` object contains a single element.\\nThe key is ``None`` indicating that the file 'source.txt' was loaded from the root location\\n(None). The content is a ``ParsedSourceFile`` object with the following attributes:\\n\\n- **path**: full path of the source file\\n- **mtime**: modification file of the source file\\n- **content_hash**: hash of the pickled content\\n- **config**: extra parameters that can be given to the parser (see below).\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    ParsedSource(\\n        parsed_source=parse.<locals>.CustomRootBlock(\\n            opening=BOF(start_line=0, start_col=0, end_line=0, end_col=0, raw=None, content_hash=Hash(algorithm_name='blake2b', hexdigest='3d8ce0051dcdd6f0f80ef789a0df179509d927874f242005ac41ed886ae0b71a30b845b9bfcb30194461c0ef6a3ca324c36f411dfafc7e588611f1eb0269bb5a'), path=PosixPath('/Users/grecco/Documents/code/flexparser/examples/in_readme/source2.txt'), mtime=1658550707.1248093),\\n            body=(\\n                Block.subclass_with.<locals>.CustomBlock(\\n                    opening=Begin(start_line=1, start_col=0, end_line=1, end_col=5, raw='begin'),\\n                    body=(\\n                        Assigment(start_line=2, start_col=0, end_line=2, end_col=12, raw='one <- other', lhs='one', rhs='other'),\\n                        InvalidIdentifier(start_line=3, start_col=0, end_line=3, end_col=11, raw='2two <- new', value='2two'),\\n                        Assigment(start_line=4, start_col=0, end_line=4, end_col=17, raw='three <- newvalue', lhs='three', rhs='newvalue')\\n                    ),\\n                    closing=End(start_line=5, start_col=0, end_line=5, end_col=3, raw='end')),\\n                EqualityComparison(start_line=6, start_col=0, end_line=6, end_col=12, raw='one == three', lhs='one', rhs='three')),\\n            closing=EOS(start_line=7, start_col=0, end_line=7, end_col=0, raw=None)),\\n        config=None\\n    )\\n\\n\\nA few things to notice:\\n\\n1. We were using a block before without knowing. The ``RootBlock`` is a\\n   special type of Block that starts and ends automatically with the\\n   file.\\n2. ``opening``, ``body``, ``closing`` are automatically annotated with the\\n   possible ``ParsedStatement`` (plus `ParsingError`),\\n   therefore autocompletes works in most IDEs.\\n3. The same is true for the defined ``ParsedStatement`` (we have use\\n   ``dataclass`` for a reason). This makes using the actual\\n   result of the parsing a charm!.\\n4. That annoying ``subclass_with.<locals>`` is because we have built\\n   a class on the fly when we used ``Block.subclass_with``. You can\\n   get rid of it (which is actually useful for pickling) by explicit\\n   subclassing Block in your code (see below).\\n\\n\\nMultiple source files\\n---------------------\\n\\nMost projects have more than one source file internally connected.\\nA file might refer to another that also need to be parsed (e.g. an\\n`#include` statement in c). **flexparser** provides the ``IncludeStatement``\\nbase class specially for this purpose.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Include(fp.IncludeStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"A naive implementation of #include \\\"file\\\"\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        value: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            if s.startwith(\\\"#include \\\"):\\n                return None\\n\\n            value = s[len(\\\"#include \\\"):].strip().strip('\\\"')\\n\\n            return cls(value)\\n\\n        @propery\\n        def target(self):\\n            return self.value\\n\\nThe only difference is that you need to implement a ``target`` property\\nthat returns the file name or resource that this statement refers to.\\n\\n\\nCustomizing statementization\\n----------------------------\\n\\nstatementi ... what? **flexparser** works by trying to parse each statement with\\none of the known classes. So it is fair to ask what is an statement in this\\ncontext and how can you configure it to your needs. A text file is split into\\nnon overlapping strings called **statements**. Parsing work as follows:\\n\\n1. each file is split into statements (can be single or multi line).\\n2. each statement is parsed with the first of the contextually\\n   available ParsedStatement or Block subclassed that returns\\n   a ``ParsedStatement`` or ``ParsingError``\\n\\nYou can customize how to split each line into statements with two arguments\\nprovided to parse:\\n\\n- **strip_spaces** (`bool`): indicates that leading and trailing spaces must\\n  be removed before attempting to parse.\\n  (default: True)\\n- **delimiters** (`dict`): indicates how each line must be subsplit.\\n  (default: do not divide)\\n\\nAn delimiter example might be\\n``{\\\";\\\": (fp.DelimiterInclude.SKIP, fp.DelimiterAction.CONTINUE)}``\\nwhich tells the statementizer (sorry) that when a \\\";\\\" is found a new statement should\\nbegin. ``DelimiterMode.SKIP`` tells that \\\";\\\" should not be added to the previous\\nstatement nor to the next. Other valid values are ``SPLIT_AFTER`` and ``SPLIT_BEFORE``\\nto append or prepend the delimiter character to the previous or next statement.\\nThe second element tells the statementizer (sorry again) what to do next:\\nvalid values are: `CONTINUE`, `CAPTURE_NEXT_TIL_EOL`, `STOP_PARSING_LINE`, and\\n`STOP_PARSING`.\\n\\nThis is useful with comments. For example,\\n``{\\\"#\\\": (fp.DelimiterMode.WITH_NEXT, fp.DelimiterAction.CAPTURE_NEXT_TIL_EOL))}``\\ntells the statementizer (it is not funny anymore) that after the first \\\"#\\\"\\nit should stop splitting and capture all.\\n\\nThis allows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    ## This will work as a single statement\\n    # This will work as a single statement #\\n    # This will work as # a single statement #\\n    a = 3 # this will produce two statements (a=3, and the rest)\\n\\n\\nExplicit Block classes\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    class AssigmentBlock(fp.Block[Begin, Assigment, End]):\\n        pass\\n\\n    class EntryBlock(fp.RootBlock[Union[AssigmentBlock, Equality]]):\\n        pass\\n\\n    parsed = fp.parse(\\\"source.txt\\\", EntryBlock)\\n\\n\\nCustomizing parsing\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn certain cases you might want to leave to the user some configuration\\ndetails. We have method for that!. Instead of overriding ``from_string``\\noverride ``from_string_and_config``. The second argument is an object\\nthat can be given to the parser, which in turn will be passed to each\\n``ParsedStatement`` class.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class NumericAssigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: numbers.Number\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string_and_config(cls, s, config):\\n            if \\\"==\\\" not in s:\\n                # This means: I do not know how to parse it\\n                # try with another ParsedStatement class.\\n                return None\\n            lhs, rhs = s.split(\\\"==\\\")\\n            return cls(lhs.strip(), config.numeric_type(rhs.strip()))\\n\\n    class Config:\\n\\n        numeric_type = float\\n\\n    parsed = fp.parse(\\\"source.txt\\\", NumericAssigment, Config)\\n\\n----\\n\\nThis project was started as a part of Pint_, the python units package.\\n\\nSee AUTHORS_ for a list of the maintainers.\\n\\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\\nsee CHANGES_\\n\\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexparser/blob/main/AUTHORS\\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexparser/blob/main/CHANGES\\n.. _`Pint`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"# `pure_eval`\\n\\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexmojaki/pure_eval.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexmojaki/pure_eval) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/alexmojaki/pure_eval/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/alexmojaki/pure_eval?branch=master) [![Supports Python versions 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pure_eval.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pure_eval)\\n\\nThis is a Python package that lets you safely evaluate certain AST nodes without triggering arbitrary code that may have unwanted side effects.\\n\\nIt can be installed from PyPI:\\n\\n    pip install pure_eval\\n\\nTo demonstrate usage, suppose we have an object defined as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Rectangle:\\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\\n        self.width = width\\n        self.height = height\\n\\n    @property\\n    def area(self):\\n        print(\\\"Calculating area...\\\")\\n        return self.width * self.height\\n\\n\\nrect = Rectangle(3, 5)\\n```\\n\\nGiven the `rect` object, we want to evaluate whatever expressions we can in this source code:\\n\\n```python\\nsource = \\\"(rect.width, rect.height, rect.area)\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis library works with the AST, so let's parse the source code and peek inside:\\n\\n```python\\nimport ast\\n\\ntree = ast.parse(source)\\nthe_tuple = tree.body[0].value\\nfor node in the_tuple.elts:\\n    print(ast.dump(node))\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='width', ctx=Load())\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='height', ctx=Load())\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='area', ctx=Load())\\n```\\n\\nNow to actually use the library. First construct an Evaluator:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import Evaluator\\n\\nevaluator = Evaluator({\\\"rect\\\": rect})\\n```\\n\\nThe argument to `Evaluator` should be a mapping from variable names to their values. Or if you have access to the stack frame where `rect` is defined, you can instead use:\\n\\n```python\\nevaluator = Evaluator.from_frame(frame)\\n```\\n\\nNow to evaluate some nodes, using `evaluator[node]`:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(\\\"rect.width:\\\", evaluator[the_tuple.elts[0]])\\nprint(\\\"rect:\\\", evaluator[the_tuple.elts[0].value])\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\nrect.width: 3\\nrect: <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105b0dd30>\\n```\\n\\nOK, but you could have done the same thing with `eval`. The useful part is that it will refuse to evaluate the property `rect.area` because that would trigger unknown code. If we try, it'll raise a `CannotEval` exception.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import CannotEval\\n\\ntry:\\n    print(\\\"rect.area:\\\", evaluator[the_tuple.elts[2]])  # fails\\nexcept CannotEval as e:\\n    print(e)  # prints CannotEval\\n```\\n\\nTo find all the expressions that can be evaluated in a tree:\\n\\n```python\\nfor node, value in evaluator.find_expressions(tree):\\n    print(ast.dump(node), value)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='width', ctx=Load()) 3\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='height', ctx=Load()) 5\\nName(id='rect', ctx=Load()) <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105568d30>\\nName(id='rect', ctx=Load()) <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105568d30>\\nName(id='rect', ctx=Load()) <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105568d30>\\n```\\n\\nNote that this includes `rect` three times, once for each appearance in the source code. Since all these nodes are equivalent, we can group them together:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import group_expressions\\n\\nfor nodes, values in group_expressions(evaluator.find_expressions(tree)):\\n    print(len(nodes), \\\"nodes with value:\\\", values)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\n1 nodes with value: 3\\n1 nodes with value: 5\\n3 nodes with value: <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x10d374d30>\\n```\\n\\nIf we want to list all the expressions in a tree, we may want to filter out certain expressions whose values are obvious. For example, suppose we have a function `foo`:\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo():\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\nIf we refer to `foo` by its name as usual, then that's not interesting:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import is_expression_interesting\\n\\nnode = ast.parse('foo').body[0].value\\nprint(ast.dump(node))\\nprint(is_expression_interesting(node, foo))\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nName(id='foo', ctx=Load())\\nFalse\\n```\\n\\nBut if we refer to it by a different name, then it's interesting:\\n\\n```python\\nnode = ast.parse('bar').body[0].value\\nprint(ast.dump(node))\\nprint(is_expression_interesting(node, foo))\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nName(id='bar', ctx=Load())\\nTrue\\n```\\n\\nIn general `is_expression_interesting` returns False for the following values:\\n- Literals (e.g. `123`, `'abc'`, `[1, 2, 3]`, `{'a': (), 'b': ([1, 2], [3])}`)\\n- Variables or attributes whose name is equal to the value's `__name__`, such as `foo` above or `self.foo` if it was a method.\\n- Builtins (e.g. `len`) referred to by their usual name.\\n\\nTo make things easier, you can combine finding expressions, grouping them, and filtering out the obvious ones with:\\n\\n```python\\nevaluator.interesting_expressions_grouped(root)\\n```\\n\\nTo get the source code of an AST node, I recommend [asttokens](https://github.com/gristlabs/asttokens).\\n\\nHere's a complete example that brings it all together:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom asttokens import ASTTokens\\nfrom pure_eval import Evaluator\\n\\nsource = \\\"\\\"\\\"\\nx = 1\\nd = {x: 2}\\ny = d[x]\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nnames = {}\\nexec(source, names)\\natok = ASTTokens(source, parse=True)\\nfor nodes, value in Evaluator(names).interesting_expressions_grouped(atok.tree):\\n    print(atok.get_text(nodes[0]), \\\"=\\\", value)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 1\\nd = {1: 2}\\ny = 2\\nd[x] = 2\\n```\\n\",\n",

In particular, the [`ForceField`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField.html#openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField) class is used to load SMIRNOFF-format force fields and the [`create_openmm_system`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField.html#openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField.create_openmm_system) method enables the parametrization of small molecules into OpenMM objects.\\n\\nDetailed usage examples can be found in the [OpenFF Toolkit repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/tree/main/examples).\\n\\nEach mainline force field is currently available in two forms -- both with and without bond constraints to hydrogen. The default version of each force field (i.e. `openff-2.0.0.offxml`) is suitable for typical molecular dynamics simulations with constrained bonds to hydrogen. The \\\"unconstrained\\\" version of each force field (i.e. `openff_unconstrained-2.0.0.offxml`) should be used when single-point energies are a major concern (e.g. geometry optimizations) and when comparing the force field to QM data.\\n\\nThis repository may also contain other useful force fields, data, or utilities, separate from mainline OpenFF force fields. More information on those can be found in the `docs/` directory in this repository.\\n\\n## How to cite\\n\\nTo cite the **Parsley** line of force fields (`openff-1.Y.Z`) please use [this citation](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00571).\\n\\nTo cite the **Sage** line of force fields (`openff-2.Y.Z`) please use [this citation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00039).\\n\\nOptionally, consider also citing the version-specific Zenodo DOI for the particular force field from the table below.\\n\\nDetails for each force field in this repository can be found in the following table:\\n\\n| Filename                                    | DOI

If the [OpenFF Toolkit](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/) is installed, it will automatically detect and use this entry point when loading OFFXML files:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff import ForceField\\nff = ForceField('openff-2.0.0.offxml')\\n```\\n\\nOtherwise, the entry point can be [accessed by querying](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#entry-points) the `openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory` entry point group.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom importlib.metadata import entry_points\\n\\nfor entry_point in iter_entry_points(group='openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory'):\\n    print(entry_point.load()())\\n```\\n\\nFor convenience, the OpenFF Toolkit also has a standalone function [`get_available_force_fields`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.get_available_force_fields.html#openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.get_available_force_fields) that lists the force fields discered by this entry point group:\\n\\n```pycon\\n>>> from openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield import get_available_force_fields\\n>>> get_available_force_fields()\\n['smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.2.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.0.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.1.0.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.4.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.8.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.6.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.3.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.1.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.5.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.9.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.7.offxml', 'ff14sb_off_impropers_0.0.2.offxml', 'ff14sb_0.0.1.offxml', 'ff14sb_0.0.3.offxml', 'ff14sb_off_impropers_0.0.1.offxml', 'ff14sb_off_impropers_0.0.3.offxml', 'ff14sb_0.0.2.offxml', 'openff-1.0.1.offxml', 'openff-1.1.1.offxml', 'openff-1.0.0-RC1.offxml', 'openff-1.2.0.offxml', 'openff-1.3.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-2.0.0-rc.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.3.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.2.1.offxml', 'openff-2.0.0-rc.2.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.0-RC2.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.1.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.0.offxml', 'openff-2.0.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-2.0.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-2.0.0-rc.2.offxml', 'openff-1.1.0.offxml', 'openff-1.0.0.offxml', 'openff-1.0.0-RC2.offxml', 'openff-1.3.1.offxml', 'openff-1.2.1.offxml', 'openff-1.3.1-alpha.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.0-RC1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.2.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.3.0.offxml', 'openff-2.0.0-rc.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.1.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.3.1-alpha.1.offxml']\\n```\\n\\n## History\\n\\nForce fields in the Parsley and Sage lines are descended from the [SMIRNOFF99Frosst line of force fields](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/).\\nThe first official release (`openff-1.0.0.offxml`, code name \\\"Parsley\\\") was made in September 2019 as a result of the Open Force Field Initiative's refitting efforts.\\n\\n## General versioning guidelines\\n\\n_Applicable in general to SMIRNOFF-format FFs produced by the Open Force Field Consortium_\\n\\nForce fields moving forward will be called `name-X.Y.Z`\\n\\n* `X` denotes some major change in functional form or fitting strategy.\\n* `Y` is the parameterization epoch / generation, or a minor change that can affect energy.\\n* `Z` is a bugfix version -- e.g. something we've caught and corrected.\\n\\n\\n## Versions\\n- `v1.0.0 Parsley` : First major forcefield release.\\n\\n- `v1.0.1 Parsley `: This bugfix release contains following changes: (1) Addition of monatomic ion `LibraryCharges`.\\n\\n- `v1.1.0 Parsley `: This minor release contains following changes: (1) Addition of new proper torsions and improper torsions for tetrazole; (2) Corrections to N-N bond rotation periodicity; (3) Removal of redundant periodicity component in `t19`; (4) Addition of three new bond and angle terms, `a22a`, `b14a` and `b36a`.\\n\\n- `v1.1.1 Parsley `: This bugfix release contains following changes: (1) Addition of monatomic ion `LibraryCharges`.\\n\\n- `v1.2.0 Parsley `: This minor release contains following changes: (1) New, carefully designed quantum chemical dataset was utilized in training valence parameters in the force field and (2) Removal of redundancy in `t108` SMIRKS pattern\\n\\n- `v1.2.1 Parsley `: This bugfix release manually changes two bond force constants to resolve an issue seen in propyne substituents when using hydrogen mass repartitioning with a 4fs timestep. Full details are available at https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefields/issues/19.\\n\\n- `v1.3.0 Parsley `: This minor release contains a fix of amide-related issues; (1) a poor performance of v1.2 in reproducing amide torsional energy profiles and (2) absence of appropriate torsion parameters for dialkyl amides.\\n\\n- `v1.3.1-alpha.1 Parsley`: The new force field files in this release are adapted from the openff-1.3.0 release, except that two angle parameters have been reverted to their original values from smirnoff99Frosst 1.1.0, in an attempt to fix sulphonamide geometries.\\n\\n- `v1.3.1 Parsley`: This release is identical to `v1.3.1-alpha.1 Parsley`.\\n\\n- `v2.0.0-rc.1 Sage`: This major release candidate contains both refit valence and vdW terms. Full details are available at https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc.1\\n\\n- `v2.0.0-rc.2 Sage`: This major release candidate is identical to `v2.0.0-rc.1 Sage` except that the `angle` value for `a16` has been changed to `180.0 * degree`, as the previous value of `183... * degree` causes geometry optimizers to fail to converge.\\n\\n- `v2.0.0 Sage`: This major release contains the same physical parameters as `v2.0.0-rc.2 Sage`, but has the parameter ids changed. For more information see the [openff-sage repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage).\\n\\n- `2023.02.1`: This release switches to a calendar-versioning system and adds `tip3p-1.0.0.offxml` and `tip3p-fb-1.0.0.offxml`, as well as `tip3p.offxml` and `tip3p-fb.offxml`, which will always point to the latest files in their respective lines.\\n\\n- `2023.04.1`: This release adds `openff-2.1.0-rc.1.offxml` Sage 2.1.0 Release Candidate 1, with several small parameter fixes and improvements.\\n\\n- `2023.05.0`: This release adds the `opc-1.0.0.offxml`, our initial port of the OPC water model.\\n\\n- `2023.05.1`: This release adds `openff-2.1.0.offxml`, Sage 2.1.0, with identical physics parameters to `openff-2.1.0-rc.1.offxml`.\\n\\n- `2023.06.0`: This release adds `opc-1.0.1.offxml`, standardizing the use of the string \\\"kilocalorie_per_mole\\\". It also adds `tip3p-fb-1.1.0.offxml`, which fixes a unit error in the geometric constraints and adds additional ion parameters. Finally, it adds `opc3-1.0.0.offxml` and `tip4p_fb-1.0.0.offxml`.\\n\\n- `2024.01.0`: This release adds `openff-2.1.1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.1.1.offxml`, Sage 2.1.1, which has identical parameters to Sage 2.1.0 (originally released in version `2023.05.1` of the `openff-forcefields` package) but adds Xe van der Waals parameters from [Tang, K.T., Toennies, J.P. New combining rules for well parameters and shapes of the van der Waals potential of mixed rare gas systems. Z Phys D - Atoms, Molecules and Clusters 1, 91–101 (1986).](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01384663)\\n\\n- `2024.03.0`: This release adds `openff-2.2.0-rc1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.0-rc1.offxml`, Sage 2.2.0 Release Candidate 1, which modifies some small ring internal angles and remedies issues with sulfamide geometries.\\n\\n- `2024.04.0`: This release adds `openff-2.2.0.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.0.offxml`, Sage 2.2.0, with identical parameters to `openff-2.2.0-rc1.offxml`.\\n\\n- `2024.07.0`: This release adds `openff-2.2.1-rc1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.1-rc1.offxml`, which contains re-fit valence parameters where linear angles have been pinned to linear equilibrium values.\\n\\n- `2024.09.0` This release adds the Sage 2.2.1 force field with `openff-2.2.1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.1.offxml`, with identifical parameters to 2.2.1-rc1.\\n\\n#### Acknowledgements\\n\\nProject based on the\\n[Computational Molecular Science Python Cookiecutter](https://github.com/molssi/cookiecutter-cms) version 1.0.\\n\",\n",

We recommend creating a virtual\\nenvironment, using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__ or\\nPython 3 `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ module.\\n\\n.. code:: sh\\n\\n    # download the source code to 'fonttools' folder\\n    git clone https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools.git\\n    cd fonttools\\n\\n    # create new virtual environment called e.g. 'fonttools-venv', or anything you like\\n    python -m virtualenv fonttools-venv\\n\\n    # source the `activate` shell script to enter the environment (Unix-like); to exit, just type `deactivate`\\n    . fonttools-venv/bin/activate\\n\\n    # to activate the virtual environment in Windows `cmd.exe`, do\\n    fonttools-venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.bat\\n\\n    # install in 'editable' mode\\n    pip install -e .\\n\\nOptional Requirements\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ``fontTools`` package currently has no (required) external dependencies\\nbesides the modules included in the Python Standard Library.\\nHowever, a few extra dependencies are required by some of its modules, which\\nare needed to unlock optional features.\\nThe ``fonttools`` PyPI distribution also supports so-called \\\"extras\\\", i.e. a\\nset of keywords that describe a group of additional dependencies, which can be\\nused when installing via pip, or when specifying a requirement.\\nFor example:\\n\\n.. code:: sh\\n\\n    pip install fonttools[ufo,lxml,woff,unicode]\\n\\nThis command will install fonttools, as well as the optional dependencies that\\nare required to unlock the extra features named \\\"ufo\\\", etc.\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/etree.py``\\n\\n  The module exports a ElementTree-like API for reading/writing XML files, and\\n  allows to use as the backend either the built-in ``xml.etree`` module or\\n  `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__. The latter is preferred whenever present,\\n  as it is generally faster and more secure.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``lxml``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ufoLib``\\n\\n  Package for reading and writing UFO source files; it requires:\\n\\n  * `fs <https://pypi.org/pypi/fs>`__: (aka ``pyfilesystem2``) filesystem\\n    abstraction layer.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``ufo``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/woff2.py``\\n\\n  Module to compress/decompress WOFF 2.0 web fonts; it requires:\\n\\n  * `brotli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brotli>`__: Python bindings of\\n    the Brotli compression library.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``woff``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/sfnt.py``\\n\\n  To better compress WOFF 1.0 web fonts, the following module can be used\\n  instead of the built-in ``zlib`` library:\\n\\n  * `zopfli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopfli>`__: Python bindings of\\n    the Zopfli compression library.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``woff``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/unicode.py``\\n\\n  To display the Unicode character names when dumping the ``cmap`` table\\n  with ``ttx`` we use the ``unicodedata`` module in the Standard Library.\\n  The version included in there varies between different Python versions.\\n  To use the latest available data, you can install:\\n\\n  * `unicodedata2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodedata2>`__:\\n    ``unicodedata`` backport for Python 3.x updated to the latest Unicode\\n    version 15.0.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``unicode``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/interpolatable.py``\\n\\n  Module for finding wrong contour/component order between different masters.\\n  It requires one of the following packages in order to solve the so-called\\n  \\\"minimum weight perfect matching problem in bipartite graphs\\\", or\\n  the Assignment problem:\\n\\n  * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`__: the Scientific Library\\n    for Python, which internally uses `NumPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`__\\n    arrays and hence is very fast;\\n  * `munkres <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres>`__: a pure-Python\\n    module that implements the Hungarian or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.\\n\\n  To plot the results to a PDF or HTML format, you also need to install:\\n\\n  * `pycairo <https://pypi.org/project/pycairo/>`__: Python bindings for the\\n    Cairo graphics library. Note that wheels are currently only available for\\n    Windows, for other platforms see pycairo's `installation instructions\\n    <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``interpolatable``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/plot.py``\\n\\n  Module for visualizing DesignSpaceDocument and resulting VariationModel.\\n\\n  * `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/pypi/matplotlib>`__: 2D plotting library.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``plot``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/symfont.py``\\n\\n  Advanced module for symbolic font statistics analysis; it requires:\\n\\n  * `sympy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy>`__: the Python library for\\n    symbolic mathematics.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``symfont``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/t1Lib.py``\\n\\n  To get the file creator and type of Macintosh PostScript Type 1 fonts\\n  on Python 3 you need to install the following module, as the old ``MacOS``\\n  module is no longer included in Mac Python:\\n\\n  * `xattr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr>`__: Python wrapper for\\n    extended filesystem attributes (macOS platform only).\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``type1``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/removeOverlaps.py``\\n\\n  Simplify TrueType glyphs by merging overlapping contours and components.\\n\\n  * `skia-pathops <https://pypi.python.org/pypy/skia-pathops>`__: Python\\n    bindings for the Skia library's PathOps module, performing boolean\\n    operations on paths (union, intersection, etc.).\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``pathops``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/cocoaPen.py`` and ``Lib/fontTools/pens/quartzPen.py``\\n\\n  Pens for drawing glyphs with Cocoa ``NSBezierPath`` or ``CGPath`` require:\\n\\n  * `PyObjC <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc>`__: the bridge between\\n    Python and the Objective-C runtime (macOS platform only).\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/qtPen.py``\\n\\n  Pen for drawing glyphs with Qt's ``QPainterPath``, requires:\\n\\n  * `PyQt5 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5>`__: Python bindings for\\n    the Qt cross platform UI and application toolkit.\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/reportLabPen.py``\\n\\n  Pen to drawing glyphs as PNG images, requires:\\n\\n  * `reportlab <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab>`__: Python toolkit\\n    for generating PDFs and graphics.\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/freetypePen.py``\\n\\n  Pen to drawing glyphs with FreeType as raster images, requires:\\n\\n  * `freetype-py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/freetype-py>`__: Python binding\\n    for the FreeType library.\\n    \\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/tables/otBase.py``\\n\\n  Use the Harfbuzz library to serialize GPOS/GSUB using ``hb_repack`` method, requires:\\n  \\n  * `uharfbuzz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uharfbuzz>`__: Streamlined Cython\\n    bindings for the harfbuzz shaping engine\\n    \\n  *Extra:* ``repacker``\\n\\nHow to make a new release\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n1) Update ``NEWS.rst`` with all the changes since the last release. Write a\\n   changelog entry for each PR, with one or two short sentences summarizing it,\\n   as well as links to the PR and relevant issues addressed by the PR. Do not\\n   put a new title, the next command will do it for you.\\n2) Use semantic versioning to decide whether the new release will be a 'major',\\n   'minor' or 'patch' release. It's usually one of the latter two, depending on\\n   whether new backward compatible APIs were added, or simply some bugs were fixed.\\n3) From inside a venv, first do ``pip install -r dev-requirements.txt``, then run\\n   the ``python setup.py release`` command from the tip of the ``main`` branch.\\n   By default this bumps the third or 'patch' digit only, unless you pass ``--major``\\n   or ``--minor`` to bump respectively the first or second digit.\\n   This bumps the package version string, extracts the changes since the latest\\n   version from ``NEWS.rst``, and uses that text to create an annotated git tag\\n   (or a signed git tag if you pass the ``--sign`` option and your git and Github\\n   account are configured for `signing commits <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`__\\n   using a GPG key).\\n   It also commits an additional version bump which opens the main branch for\\n   the subsequent developmental cycle\\n4) Push both the tag and commit to the upstream repository, by running the command\\n   ``git push --follow-tags``. Note: it may push other local tags as well, be\\n   careful.\\n5) Let the CI build the wheel and source distribution packages and verify both\\n   get uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).\\n6) [Optional] Go to fonttools `Github Releases <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/releases>`__\\n   page and create a new release, copy-pasting the content of the git tag\\n   message. This way, the release notes are nicely formatted as markdown, and\\n   users watching the repo will get an email notification. One day we shall\\n   automate that too.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn alphabetical order:\\n\\naschmitz, Olivier Berten, Samyak Bhuta, Erik van Blokland, Petr van Blokland,\\nJelle Bosma, Sascha Brawer, Tom Byrer, Antonio Cavedoni, Frédéric Coiffier,\\nVincent Connare, David Corbett, Simon Cozens, Dave Crossland, Simon Daniels,\\nPeter Dekkers, Behdad Esfahbod, Behnam Esfahbod, Hannes Famira, Sam Fishman,\\nMatt Fontaine, Takaaki Fuji, Rob Hagemans, Yannis Haralambous, Greg Hitchcock,\\nJeremie Hornus, Khaled Hosny, John Hudson, Denis Moyogo Jacquerye, Jack Jansen,\\nTom Kacvinsky, Jens Kutilek, Antoine Leca, Werner Lemberg, Tal Leming, Liang Hai, Peter\\nLofting, Cosimo Lupo, Olli Meier, Masaya Nakamura, Dave Opstad, Laurence Penney,\\nRoozbeh Pournader, Garret Rieger, Read Roberts, Colin Rofls, Guido van Rossum,\\nJust van Rossum, Andreas Seidel, Georg Seifert, Chris Simpkins, Miguel Sousa,\\nAdam Twardoch, Adrien Tétar, Vitaly Volkov, Paul Wise.\\n\\nCopyrights\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n| Copyright (c) 1999-2004 Just van Rossum, LettError\\n  (just@letterror.com)\\n| See `LICENSE <LICENSE>`__ for the full license.\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2000 BeOpen.com.

sentinel value 0xFFFF to mark a glyph advance in hmtx/vmtx as non\\n  participating, allowing sparse masters to contain glyphs for variation purposes other\\n  than {H,V}VAR (#3235).\\n- [varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in non-default masters as missing, thus not participating\\n  in CFF2 delta computation, similarly to how varLib already treats them for gvar (#3234).\\n- Added varLib.avarPlanner

(#3164).\\n\\n4.40.0 (released 2023-06-12)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Published native binary wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions and platform\\n  and architectures currently supported that would benefit from this. They will include\\n  precompiled Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to compile them\\n  from source. The pure-python wheel and source distribution will continue to be\\n  published as always (pip will automatically chose them when no binary wheel is\\n  available for the given platform, e.g. pypy). Use ``pip install --no-binary=fonttools fonttools``\\n  to expliclity request pip to install from the pure-python source.\\n- [designspaceLib|varLib] Add initial support for specifying axis mappings and build\\n  ``avar2`` table from those (#3123).\\n- [feaLib] Support variable ligature caret position (#3130).\\n- [varLib|glyf] Added option to --drop-implied-oncurves; test for impliable oncurve\\n  points either before or after rounding (#3146, #3147, #3155, #3156).\\n- [TTGlyphPointPen] Don't error with empty contours, simply ignore them (#3145).\\n- [sfnt] Fixed str vs bytes remnant of py3 transition in code dealing with de/compiling\\n  WOFF metadata (#3129).\\n- [instancer-solver] Fixed bug when moving default instance with sparse masters (#3139, #3140).\\n- [feaLib] Simplify variable scalars that don’t vary (#3132).\\n- [pens] Added filter pen that explicitly emits closing line when lastPt != movePt (#3100).\\n- [varStore] Improve optimize algorithm and better document the algorithm (#3124, #3127).\\n  Added ``quantization`` option (#3126).\\n- Added CI workflow config file for building native binary wheels (#3121).\\n- [fontBuilder] Added glyphDataFormat=0 option; raise error when glyphs contain cubic\\n  outlines but glyphDataFormat was not explicitly set to 1 (#3113, #3119).\\n- [subset] Prune emptied GDEF.MarkGlyphSetsDef and remap indices; ensure GDEF is\\n  subsetted before GSUB and GPOS (#3114, #3118).\\n- [xmlReader] Fixed issue whereby DSIG table data was incorrectly parsed (#3115, #2614).\\n- [varLib/merger] Fixed merging of SinglePos with pos=0 (#3111, #3112).\\n- [feaLib] Demote \\\"Feature has not been defined\\\" error to a warning when building aalt\\n  and referenced feature is empty (#3110).\\n- [feaLib] Dedupe multiple substitutions with classes (#3105).\\n\\n4.39.4 (released 2023-05-10)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow for sparse masters (#3075)\\n- [merge] Handle differing default/nominalWidthX in CFF (#3070)\\n- [ttLib] Add missing main.py file to ttLib package (#3088)\\n- [ttx] Fix missing composite instructions in XML (#3092)\\n- [ttx] Fix split tables option to work on filenames containing '%' (#3096)\\n- [featureVars] Process lookups for features other than rvrn last (#3099)\\n- [feaLib] support multiple substitution with classes (#3103)\\n\\n4.39.3 (released 2023-03-28)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [sbix] Fixed TypeError when compiling empty glyphs whose imageData is None, regression\\n  was introduced in v4.39 (#3059).\\n- [ttFont] Fixed AttributeError on python <= 3.10 when opening a TTFont from a tempfile\\n  SpooledTemporaryFile, seekable method only added on python 3.11 (#3052).\\n\\n4.39.2 (released 2023-03-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Fixed regression introduced in 4.39.1 whereby an incomplete 'STAT' table\\n  would be built even though a DesignSpace v5 did contain 'STAT' definitions (#3045, #3046).\\n\\n4.39.1 (released 2023-03-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [avar2] Added experimental support for reading/writing avar version 2 as specified in\\n  this draft proposal: https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/avar2.md\\n- [glifLib] Wrap underlying XML library exceptions with GlifLibError when parsing GLIFs,\\n  and also print the name and path of the glyph that fails to be parsed (#3042).\\n- [feaLib] Consult avar for normalizing user-space values in ConditionSets and in\\n  VariableScalars (#3042, #3043).\\n- [ttProgram] Handle string input to Program.fromAssembly() (#3038).\\n- [otlLib] Added a config option to emit GPOS 7 lookups, currently disabled by default\\n  because of a macOS bug (#3034).\\n- [COLRv1] Added method to automatically compute ClipBoxes (#3027).\\n- [ttFont] Fixed getGlyphID to raise KeyError on missing glyphs instead of returning\\n  None.

Kudos to behdad for\\n  spotting one of the oldest bugs in FT. Probably nobody has ever dared to make\\n  glyphs with more than 32767 points... (#2957).\\n- [feaLib] Fixed handling of ``ignore`` statements with unmarked glyphs to match\\n  makeotf behavior, which assumes the first glyph is marked (#2950).\\n- Reformatted code with ``black`` and enforce new code style via CI check (#2925).\\n- [feaLib] Sort name table entries following OT spec prescribed order in the builder (#2927).\\n- [cu2quPen] Add Cu2QuMultiPen that converts multiple outlines at a time in\\n  interpolation compatible way; its methods take a list of tuples arguments\\n  that would normally be passed to individual segment pens, and at the end it\\n  dispatches the converted outlines to each pen (#2912).\\n- [reverseContourPen/ttGlyphPen] Add outputImpliedClosingLine option (#2913, #2914,\\n  #2921, #2922, #2995).\\n- [gvar] Avoid expanding all glyphs unnecessarily upon compile (#2918).\\n- [scaleUpem] Fixed bug whereby CFF2 vsindex was scaled; it should not (#2893, #2894).\\n- [designspaceLib] Add DS.getAxisByTag and refactor getAxis (#2891).\\n- [unicodedata] map Zmth<->math in ot_tag_{to,from}_script (#1737, #2889).\\n- [woff2] Support encoding/decoding OVERLAP_SIMPLE glyf flags (#2576, #2884).\\n- [instancer] Update OS/2 class and post.italicAngle when default moved (L4)\\n- Dropped support for Python 3.7 which reached EOL, fontTools requires 3.8+.\\n- [instancer] Fixed instantiateFeatureVariations logic when a rule range becomes\\n  default-applicable (#2737, #2880).\\n- [ttLib] Add main to ttFont and ttCollection that just decompile and re-compile the\\n  input font (#2869).\\n- [featureVars] Insert 'rvrn' lookup at the beginning of LookupList, to work around bug\\n  in Apple implementation of 'rvrn' feature which the spec says it should be processed\\n  early whereas on macOS 10.15 it follows lookup order (#2140, #2867).\\n- [instancer/mutator] Remove 'DSIG' table if present.\\n- [svgPathPen] Don't close path in endPath(), assume open unless closePath() (#2089, #2865).\\n\\n4.38.0 (released 2022-10-21)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.instancer] Added support for L4 instancing, i.e. moving the default value of\\n  an axis while keeping it variable. Thanks Behdad! (#2728, #2861).\\n  It's now also possible to restrict an axis min/max values beyond the current default\\n  value, e.g. a font wght has min=100, def=400, max=900 and you want a partial VF that\\n  only varies between 500 and 700, you can now do that.\\n  You can either specify two min/max values (wght=500:700), and the new default will be\\n  set to either the minimum or maximum, depending on which one is closer to the current\\n  default (e.g. 500 in this case). Or you can specify three values (e.g. wght=500:600:700)\\n  to specify the new default value explicitly.\\n- [otlLib/featureVars] Set a few Count values so one doesn't need to compile the font\\n  to update them (#2860).\\n- [varLib.models] Make extrapolation work for 2-master models as well where one master\\n  is at the default location (#2843, #2846).\\n  Add optional extrapolate=False to normalizeLocation() (#2847, #2849).\\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed sub-optimal packing of CFF2 deltas by no longer rounding them to\\n  integer (#2838).\\n- [scaleUpem] Calculate numShorts in VarData after scale; handle CFF hintmasks (#2840).\\n\\n4.37.4 (released 2022-09-30)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Keep nameIDs used by CPAL palette entry labels (#2837).\\n- [varLib] Avoid negative hmtx values when creating font from variable CFF2 font (#2827).\\n- [instancer] Don't prune stat.ElidedFallbackNameID (#2828).\\n- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/Blocks to Unicode 15.0 (#2833).\\n\\n4.37.3 (released 2022-09-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Fix arguments in calls to (glyf) glyph.draw() and drawPoints(), whereby offset wasn't\\n  correctly passed down; this fix also exposed a second bug, where lsb and tsb were not\\n  set (#2824, #2825, adobe-type-tools/afdko#1560).\\n\\n4.37.2 (released 2022-09-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Keep CPAL table and don't attempt to prune unused color indices if OT-SVG\\n  table is present even if COLR table was subsetted away; OT-SVG may be referencing the\\n  CPAL table; for now we assume that's the case (#2814, #2815).\\n- [varLib.instancer] Downgrade GPOS/GSUB version if there are no more FeatureVariations\\n  after instancing (#2812).\\n- [subset] Added ``--no-lazy`` to optionally load fonts eagerly (mostly to ease\\n  debugging of table lazy loading, no practical effects) (#2807).\\n- [varLib] Avoid building empty COLR.DeltaSetIndexMap with only identity mappings (#2803).\\n- [feaLib] Allow multiple value record types (by promoting to the most general format)\\n  within the same PairPos subtable; e.g. this allows variable and non variable kerning\\n  rules to share the same subtable. This also fixes a bug whereby some kerning pairs\\n  would become unreachable while shapiong because of premature subtable splitting (#2772, #2776).\\n- [feaLib] Speed up ``VarScalar`` by caching models for recurring master locations (#2798).\\n- [feaLib] Optionally cythonize ``feaLib.lexer``, speeds up parsing FEA a bit (#2799).\\n- [designspaceLib] Avoid crash when handling unbounded rule conditions (#2797).\\n- [post] Don't crash if ``post`` legacy format 1 is malformed/improperly used (#2786)\\n- [gvar] Don't be \\\"lazy\\\" (load all glyph variations up front) when TTFont.lazy=False (#2771).\\n- [TTFont] Added ``normalizeLocation`` method to normalize a location dict from the\\n  font's defined axes space (also known as \\\"user space\\\") into the normalized (-1..+1)\\n  space.

Added ``fontTools.ttLib.scaleUpem`` module that uses the latter to\\n  change a font's units-per-em and scale all the related fields accordingly (#2718,\\n  #2755).\\n\\n4.36.0 (released 2022-08-17)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.models] Use a simpler model that generates narrower \\\"tents\\\" (regions, master\\n  supports) whenever possible: specifically when any two axes that actively \\\"cooperate\\\"\\n  (have masters at non-zero positions for both axes) have a complete set of intermediates.\\n  The simpler algorithm produces fewer overlapping regions and behaves better with\\n  respect to rounding at the peak positions than the generic solver, always matching\\n  intermediate masters exactly, instead of maximally 0.5 units off. This may be useful\\n  when 100% metrics compatibility is desired (#2218, #2717).\\n- [feaLib] Remove warning when about ``GDEF`` not being built when explicitly not\\n  requested; don't build one unconditonally even when not requested (#2744, also works\\n  around #2747).\\n- [ttFont] ``TTFont.getGlyphSet`` method now supports selecting a location that\\n  represents an instance of a variable font (supports both user-scale and normalized\\n  axes coordinates via the ``normalized=False`` parameter). Currently this only works\\n  for TrueType-flavored variable fonts (#2738).\\n\\n4.35.0 (released 2022-08-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otData/otConverters] Added support for 'biased' PaintSweepGradient start/end angles\\n  to match latest COLRv1 spec (#2743).\\n- [varLib.instancer] Fixed bug in ``_instantiateFeatureVariations`` when at the same\\n  time pinning one axis and restricting the range of a subsequent axis; the wrong axis\\n  tag was being used in the latter step (as the records' axisIdx was updated in the\\n  preceding step but looked up using the old axes order in the following step) (#2733,\\n  #2734).\\n- [mtiLib] Pad script tags with space when less than 4 char long (#1727).\\n- [merge] Use ``'.'`` instead of ``'#'`` in duplicate glyph names (#2742).\\n- [gvar] Added support for lazily loading glyph variations (#2741).\\n- [varLib] In ``build_many``, we forgot to pass on ``colr_layer_reuse`` parameter to\\n  the ``build`` method (#2730).\\n- [svgPathPen] Add a main that prints SVG for input text (6df779fd).\\n- [cffLib.width] Fixed off-by-one in optimized values; previous code didn't match the\\n  code block above it (2963fa50).\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Support reading .designspace and .glyphs files (via optional\\n  ``glyphsLib``).\\n- Compile some modules with Cython when available and building/installing fonttools\\n  from source: ``varLib.iup`` (35% faster), ``pens.momentsPen`` (makes\\n  ``varLib.interpolatable`` 3x faster).\\n- [feaLib] Allow features to be built for VF without also building a GDEF table (e.g.\\n  only build GSUB); warn when GDEF would be needed but isn't requested (#2705, 2694).\\n- [otBase] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when uharfbuzz < 0.23.0 and 'repack' method is\\n  missing (32aa8eaf). Use new ``uharfbuzz.repack_with_tag`` when available (since\\n  uharfbuzz>=0.30.0), enables table-specific optimizations to be performed during\\n  repacking (#2724).\\n- [statisticsPen] By default report all glyphs (4139d891). Avoid division-by-zero\\n  (52b28f90).\\n- [feaLib] Added missing required argument to FeatureLibError exception (#2693)\\n- [varLib.merge] Fixed error during error reporting (#2689). Fixed undefined\\n  ``NotANone`` variable (#2714).\\n\\n4.34.4 (released 2022-07-07)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Fixed typo in varLib/merger.py that causes NameError merging COLR glyphs\\n  containing more than 255 layers (#2685).\\n\\n4.34.3 (released 2022-07-07)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Don't make up bad PS names when no STAT data (#2684)\\n\\n4.34.2 (released 2022-07-06)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varStore/subset] fixed KeyError exception to do with NO_VARIATION_INDEX while\\n  subsetting varidxes in GPOS/GDEF (a08140d).\\n\\n4.34.1 (released 2022-07-06)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [instancer] When optimizing HVAR/VVAR VarStore, use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=False to avoid\\n  including NO_VARIATION_INDEX in AdvWidthMap, RsbMap, LsbMap mappings, which would\\n  push the VarIdx width to maximum (4bytes), which is not desirable. This also fixes\\n  a hard crash when attempting to subset a varfont after it had been partially instanced\\n  with use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=True.\\n\\n4.34.0 (released 2022-07-06)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [instancer] Set RIBBI bits in head and OS/2 table when cutting instances and the\\n  subfamily nameID=2 contains strings like 'Italic' or 'Bold' (#2673).\\n- [otTraverse] Addded module containing methods for traversing trees of otData tables\\n  (#2660).\\n- [otTables] Made DeltaSetIndexMap TTX dump less verbose by omitting no-op entries\\n  (#2660).\\n- [colorLib.builder] Added option to disable PaintColrLayers's reuse of layers from\\n  LayerList (#2660).\\n- [varLib] Added support for merging multiple master COLRv1 tables into a variable\\n  COLR table (#2660, #2328). Base color glyphs of same name in different masters must have\\n  identical paint graph structure (incl. number of layers, palette indices, number\\n  of color line stops, corresponding paint formats at each level of the graph),\\n  but can differ in the variable fields (e.g. PaintSolid.Alpha). PaintVar* tables\\n  are produced when this happens and a VarStore/DeltaSetIndexMap is added to the\\n  variable COLR table. It is possible for non-default masters to be 'sparse', i.e.\\n  omit some of the color glyphs present in the default master.\\n- [feaLib] Let the Parser set nameIDs 1 through 6 that were previously reserved (#2675).\\n- [varLib.varStore] Support NO_VARIATION_INDEX in optimizer and instancer.\\n- [feaLib] Show all missing glyphs at once at end of parsing (#2665).\\n- [varLib.iup] Rewrite force-set conditions and limit DP loopback length (#2651).\\n  For Noto Sans, IUP time drops from 23s down to 9s, with only a slight size increase\\n  in the final font. This basically turns the algorithm from O(n^3) into O(n).\\n- [featureVars] Report about missing glyphs in substitution rules (#2654).\\n- [mutator/instancer] Added CLI flag to --no-recalc-timestamp (#2649).\\n- [SVG] Allow individual SVG documents in SVG OT table to be compressed on uncompressed,\\n  and remember that when roundtripping to/from ttx. The SVG.docList is now a list\\n  of SVGDocument namedtuple-like dataclass containing an extra ``compressed`` field,\\n  and no longer a bare 3-tuple (#2645).\\n- [designspaceLib] Check for descriptor types with hasattr() to allow custom classes\\n  that don't inherit the default descriptors (#2634).\\n- [subset] Enable sharing across subtables of extension lookups for harfbuzz packing\\n  (#2626). Updated how table packing falls back to fontTools from harfbuzz (#2668).\\n- [subset] Updated default feature tags following current Harfbuzz (#2637).\\n- [svgLib] Fixed regex for real number to support e.g. 1e-4 in addition to 1.0e-4.\\n  Support parsing negative rx, ry on arc commands (#2596, #2611).\\n- [subset] Fixed subsetting SinglePosFormat2 when ValueFormat=0 (#2603).\\n\\n4.33.3 (released 2022-04-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Fixed typo in ``deepcopyExceptFonts`` method, preventing font\\n  references to be transferred (#2600). Fixed another typo in the name of ``Range``\\n  dataclass's ``__post_init__`` magic method (#2597).\\n\\n4.33.2 (released 2022-04-22)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otBase] Make logging less verbose when harfbuzz fails to serialize. Do not exit\\n  at the first failure but continue attempting to fix offset overflow error using\\n  the pure-python serializer even when the ``USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER`` option was\\n  explicitly set to ``True``. This is normal with fonts with relatively large\\n  tables, at least until hb.repack implements proper table splitting.\\n\\n4.33.1 (released 2022-04-22)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otlLib] Put back the ``FONTTOOLS_GPOS_COMPACT_MODE`` environment variable to fix\\n  regression in ufo2ft (and thus fontmake) introduced with v4.33.0 (#2592, #2593).\\n  This is deprecated and will be removed one ufo2ft gets updated to use the new\\n  config setup.\\n\\n4.33.0 (released 2022-04-21)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [OS/2 / merge] Automatically recalculate ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` after merging\\n  fonts with ``fontTools.merge`` (#2591, #2538).\\n- [misc/config] Added ``fontTools.misc.configTools`` module, a generic configuration\\n  system (#2416, #2439).\\n  Added ``fontTools.config`` module, a fontTools-specific configuration\\n  system using ``configTools`` above.\\n  Attached a ``Config`` object to ``TTFont``.\\n- [otlLib] Replaced environment variable for GPOS compression level with an\\n  equivalent option using the new config system.\\n- [designspaceLib] Incremented format version to 5.0 (#2436).\\n  Added discrete axes, variable fonts, STAT information, either design- or\\n  user-space location on instances.\\n  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.split`` module to split a designspace\\n  into sub-spaces that interpolate and that represent the variable fonts\\n  listed in the document.\\n  Made instance names optional and allow computing them from STAT data instead.\\n  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.statNames`` module.\\n  Allow instances to have the same location as a previously defined STAT label.\\n  Deprecated some attributes:\\n  ``SourceDescriptor``: ``copyLib``, ``copyInfo``, ``copyGroups``, ``copyFeatures``.\\n  ``InstanceDescriptor``: ``kerning``, ``info``; ``glyphs``: use rules or sparse\\n  sources.\\n  For both, ``location``: use the more explicit designLocation.\\n  Note: all are soft deprecations and existing code should keep working.\\n  Updated documentation for Python methods and the XML format.\\n- [varLib] Added ``build_many`` to build several variable fonts from a single\\n  designspace document (#2436).\\n  Added ``fontTools.varLib.stat`` module to build STAT tables from a designspace\\n  document.\\n- [otBase] Try to use the Harfbuzz Repacker for packing GSUB/GPOS tables when\\n  ``uharfbuzz`` python bindings are available (#2552). Disable it by setting the\\n  \\\"fontTools.ttLib.tables.otBase:USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER\\\" config option to ``False``.\\n  If the option is set explicitly to ``True`` but ``uharfbuzz`` can't be imported\\n  or fails to serialize for any reasons, an error will be raised (ImportError or\\n  uharfbuzz errors).\\n- [CFF/T2] Ensure that ``pen.closePath()`` gets called for CFF2 charstrings (#2577).\\n  Handle implicit CFF2 closePath within ``T2OutlineExtractor`` (#2580).\\n\\n4.32.0 (released 2022-04-08)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otlLib] Disable GPOS7 optimization to work around bug in Apple CoreText.\\n  Always force Chaining GPOS8 for now (#2540).\\n- [glifLib] Added ``outputImpliedClosingLine=False`` parameter to ``Glyph.draw()``,\\n  to control behaviour of ``PointToSegmentPen`` (6b4e2e7).\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Check for wrong contour starting point (#2571).\\n- [cffLib] Remove leftover ``GlobalState`` class and fix calls to ``TopDictIndex()``\\n  (#2569, #2570).\\n- [instancer] Clear ``AxisValueArray`` if it is empty after instantiating (#2563).\\n\\n4.31.2 (released 2022-03-22)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] fix instantiation of GPOS SinglePos values (#2555).\\n\\n4.31.1 (released 2022-03-18)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] fix subsetting OT-SVG when glyph id attribute is on the root ``<svg>``\\n  element (#2553).\\n\\n4.31.0 (released 2022-03-18)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ttCollection] Fixed 'ResourceWarning: unclosed file' warning (#2549).\\n- [varLib.merger] Handle merging SinglePos with valueformat=0 (#2550).\\n- [ttFont] Update glyf's glyphOrder when calling TTFont.setGlyphOrder() (#2544).\\n- [ttFont] Added ``ensureDecompiled`` method to load all tables irrespective\\n  of the ``lazy`` attribute (#2551).\\n- [otBase] Added ``iterSubTable`` method to iterate over BaseTable's children of\\n  type BaseTable; useful for traversing a tree of otTables (#2551).\\n\\n4.30.0 (released 2022-03-10)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Added debug logger showing the glyph name for which ``gvar`` is built (#2542).\\n- [varLib.errors] Fixed undefined names in ``FoundANone`` and ``UnsupportedFormat``\\n  exceptions (ac4d5611).\\n- [otlLib.builder] Added ``windowsNames`` and ``macNames`` (bool) parameters to the\\n  ``buildStatTabe`` function, so that one can select whether to only add one or both\\n  of the two sets (#2528).\\n- [t1Lib] Added the ability to recreate PostScript stream (#2504).\\n- [name] Added ``getFirstDebugName``, ``getBest{Family,SubFamily,Full}Name`` methods (#2526).\\n\\n4.29.1 (released 2022-02-01)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Fixed rounding issue with radial gradient's start/end circles inside\\n  one another (#2521).\\n- [freetypePen] Handle rotate/skew transform when auto-computing width/height of the\\n  buffer; raise PenError wen missing moveTo (#2517)\\n\\n4.29.0 (released 2022-01-24)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ufoLib] Fixed illegal characters and expanded reserved filenames (#2506).\\n- [COLRv1] Don't emit useless PaintColrLayers of lenght=1 in LayerListBuilder (#2513).\\n- [ttx] Removed legacy ``waitForKeyPress`` method on Windows (#2509).\\n- [pens] Added FreeTypePen that uses ``freetype-py`` and the pen protocol for\\n  rasterizating outline paths (#2494).\\n- [unicodedata] Updated the script direction list to Unicode 14.0 (#2484).\\n  Bumped unicodedata2 dependency to 14.0 (#2499).\\n- [psLib] Fixed type of ``fontName`` in ``suckfont`` (#2496).\\n\\n4.28.5 (released 2021-12-19)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [svgPathPen] Continuation of #2471: make sure all occurrences of ``str()`` are now\\n  replaced with user-defined ``ntos`` callable.\\n- [merge] Refactored code into submodules, plus several bugfixes and improvements:\\n  fixed duplicate-glyph-resolution GSUB-lookup generation code; use tolerance in glyph\\n  comparison for empty glyph's width; ignore space of default ignorable glyphs;\\n  downgrade duplicates-resolution missing-GSUB from assert to warn; added --drop-tables\\n  option (#2473, #2475, #2476).\\n\\n4.28.4 (released 2021-12-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [merge] Merge GDEF marksets in Lookups properly (#2474).\\n- [feaLib] Have ``fontTools feaLib`` script exit with error code when build fails (#2459)\\n- [svgPathPen] Added ``ntos`` option to customize number formatting (e.g. rounding) (#2471).\\n- [subset] Speed up subsetting of large CFF fonts (#2467).\\n- [otTables] Speculatively promote lookups to extension to speed up compilation. If the\\n  offset to lookup N is too big to fit in a ushort, the offset to lookup N+1 is going to\\n  be too big as well, so we promote to extension all lookups from lookup N onwards (#2465).\\n\\n4.28.3 (released 2021-12-03)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fixed bug while subsetting ``COLR`` table, whereby incomplete layer records\\n  pointing to missing glyphs were being retained leading to ``struct.error`` upon\\n  compiling.

They are now treated\\n  as if they are closed, like with the ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2364, #2366).\\n\\n4.25.0 (released 2021-07-05)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [tfmLib] Added new library for parsing TeX Font Metric (TFM) files (#2354).\\n- [TupleVariation] Make shared tuples order deterministic on python < 3.7 where\\n  Counter (subclass of dict) doesn't remember insertion order (#2351, #2353).\\n- [otData] Renamed COLRv1 structs to remove 'v1' suffix and match the updated draft\\n  spec: 'LayerV1List' -> 'LayerList', 'BaseGlyphV1List' -> 'BaseGlyphList',\\n  'BaseGlyphV1Record' -> 'BaseGlyphPaintRecord' (#2346).\\n  Added 8 new ``PaintScale*`` tables: with/without centers, uniform vs non-uniform.\\n  Added ``*AroundCenter`` variants to ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew``: the default\\n  versions no longer have centerX/Y, but default to origin.\\n  ``PaintRotate``, ``PaintSkew`` and ``PaintComposite`` formats were re-numbered.\\n  NOTE: these are breaking changes; clients using the experimental COLRv1 API will\\n  have to be updated (#2348).\\n- [pointPens] Allow ``GuessSmoothPointPen`` to accept a tolerance. Fixed call to\\n  ``math.atan2`` with x/y parameters inverted. Sync the code with fontPens (#2344).\\n- [post] Fixed parsing ``post`` table format 2.0 when it contains extra garbage\\n  at the end of the stringData array (#2314).\\n- [subset] drop empty features unless 'size' with FeatureParams table (#2324).\\n- [otlLib] Added ``otlLib.optimize`` module; added GPOS compaction algorithm.\\n  The compaction can be run on existing fonts with ``fonttools otlLib.optimize``\\n  or using the snippet ``compact_gpos.py``. There's experimental support for\\n  compacting fonts at compilation time using an environment variable, but that\\n  might be removed later (#2326).\\n\\n4.24.4 (released 2021-05-25)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset/instancer] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when instantiating a VF that\\n  contains GPOS ValueRecords with ``Device`` tables but without the respective\\n  non-Device values (e.g. ``XAdvDevice`` without ``XAdvance``). When not\\n  explicitly set, the latter are assumed to be 0 (#2323).\\n\\n4.24.3 (released 2021-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otTables] Fixed ``AttributeError`` in methods that split LigatureSubst,\\n  MultipleSubst and AlternateSubst subtables when an offset overflow occurs.\\n  The ``Format`` attribute was removed in v4.22.0 (#2319).\\n\\n4.24.2 (released 2021-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ttGlyphPen] Fixed typing annotation of TTGlyphPen glyphSet parameter (#2315).\\n- Fixed two instances of DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence (#2311).\\n\\n4.24.1 (released 2021-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fixed AttributeError when SinglePos subtable has None Value (ValueFormat 0)\\n  (#2312, #2313).\\n\\n4.24.0 (released 2021-05-17)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [pens] Add ``ttGlyphPen.TTGlyphPointPen`` similar to ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2205).\\n\\n4.23.1 (released 2021-05-14)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fix ``KeyError`` after subsetting ``COLR`` table that initially contains\\n  both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset only requested v1 glyphs; we were\\n  not pruning the v0 portion of the table (#2308).\\n- [colorLib] Set ``LayerV1List`` attribute to ``None`` when empty, it's optional\\n  in CORLv1 (#2308).\\n\\n4.23.0 (released 2021-05-13)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Allow to use ``\\\\\\\\UNC`` absolute paths on Windows (#2299, #2306).\\n- [varLib.merger] Fixed bug where ``VarLibMergeError`` was raised with incorrect\\n  parameters (#2300).\\n- [feaLib] Allow substituting a glyph class with ``NULL`` to delete multiple glyphs\\n  (#2303).\\n- [glyf] Fixed ``NameError`` exception in ``getPhantomPoints`` (#2295, #2305).\\n- [removeOverlaps] Retry pathops.simplify after rounding path coordinates to integers\\n  if it fails the first time using floats, to work around a rare and hard to debug\\n  Skia bug (#2288).\\n- [varLib] Added support for building, reading, writing and optimizing 32-bit\\n  ``ItemVariationStore`` as used in COLRv1 table (#2285).\\n- [otBase/otConverters] Add array readers/writers for int types (#2285).\\n- [feaLib] Allow more than one lookahead glyph/class in contextual positioning with\\n  \\\"value at end\\\" (#2293, #2294).\\n- [COLRv1] Default varIdx should be 0xFFFFFFFF (#2297, #2298).\\n- [pens] Make RecordingPointPen actually pass on identifiers; replace asserts with\\n  explicit ``PenError`` exception (#2284).\\n- [mutator] Round lsb for CF2 fonts as well (#2286).\\n\\n4.22.1 (released 2021-04-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Skip references to named lookups if the lookup block definition\\n  is empty, similarly to makeotf. This also fixes an ``AttributeError`` while\\n  generating ``aalt`` feature (#2276, #2277).\\n- [subset] Fixed bug with ``--no-hinting`` implementation for Device tables (#2272,\\n  #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping Device tables if no-hinting was\\n  requested, but some Device tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000) are also used to encode\\n  variation indices and need to be retained.\\n- [otBase] Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when decompiling ``MVAR``\\n  table with ``lazy=True`` (#2273, #2274).\\n- [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified ``GlyphCoordinates`` and\\n  ``TupleVariation`` classes, use ``bytearray`` where possible, refactored\\n  phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30% speedup in total time\\n  of loading master ttfs, building gvar, and saving (#2261, #2266).\\n- [subset] Fixed ``AssertionError`` while pruning unused CPAL palettes when\\n  ``0xFFFF`` is present (#2257, #2259).\\n\\n4.22.0 (released 2021-04-01)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst, LigatureSubst,\\n  AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).\\n  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!\\n- [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite as a tuple\\n  subclass (#2201).\\n- [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib (#2209).\\n- [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error accumulation from\\n  multiple deltas (#2214)\\n- [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly terms (#2223, #2226)\\n- [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)\\n- [varLib/otlLib] Allow merging into VariationFont without first saving GPOS\\n  PairPos2 (#2229)\\n- [subset] Improve PairPosFormat2 subsetting (#2221)\\n- [ttLib] TTFont.save: create file on disk as late as possible (#2253)\\n- [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators LanguageGroup and ExpansionFactor\\n  (#2249)\\n  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!\\n\\n4.21.1 (released 2021-02-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [pens] Reverted breaking change that turned ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen``\\n  into abstract base classes (#2164, #2198).\\n\\n4.21.0 (released 2021-02-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Indent anchor statements in ``asFea()`` to make them more legible and\\n  diff-able (#2193).\\n- [pens] Turn ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen`` into abstract base classes\\n  (#2164).\\n- [feaLib] Added support for parsing and building ``STAT`` table from AFDKO feature\\n  files (#2039).\\n- [instancer] Added option to update name table of generated instance using ``STAT``\\n  table's axis values (#2189).\\n- [bezierTools] Added functions to compute bezier point-at-time, as well as line-line,\\n  curve-line and curve-curve intersections (#2192).\\n\\n4.20.0 (released 2021-02-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [COLRv1] Added ``unbuildColrV1`` to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to raw json-able\\n  data structure; it does the reverse of ``buildColrV1`` (#2171).\\n- [feaLib] Allow ``sub X by NULL`` sequence to delete a glyph (#2170).\\n- [arrayTools] Fixed ``Vector`` division (#2173).\\n- [COLRv1] Define new ``PaintSweepGradient`` (#2172).\\n- [otTables] Moved ``Paint.Format`` enum class outside of ``Paint`` class definition,\\n  now named ``PaintFormat``. It was clashing with paint instance ``Format`` attribute\\n  and thus was breaking lazy load of COLR table which relies on magic ``__getattr__``\\n  (#2175).\\n- [COLRv1] Replace hand-coded builder functions with otData-driven dynamic\\n  implementation (#2181).\\n- [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats (#2181).\\n- [subset] Added support for subsetting COLR v1 and CPAL tables (#2174, #2177).\\n- [fontBuilder] Allow ``setupFvar`` to optionally take ``designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor``\\n  objects. Added new ``setupAvar`` method. Support localised names for axes and\\n  named instances (#2185).\\n\\n4.19.1 (released 2021-01-28)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now stays an off-curve\\n  point after compression.\\n\\n4.19.0 (released 2021-01-25)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [codecs] Handle ``errors`` parameter different from 'strict' for the custom\\n  extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).\\n- [featureVars] Raise better error message when a script is missing the required\\n  default language system (#2154).\\n- [COLRv1] Avoid abrupt change caused by rounding ``PaintRadialGradient.c0`` when\\n  the start circle almost touches the end circle's perimeter (#2148).\\n- [COLRv1] Support building unlimited lists of paints as 255-ary trees of\\n  ``PaintColrLayers`` tables (#2153).\\n- [subset] Prune redundant format-12 cmap subtables when all non-BMP characters\\n  are dropped (#2146).\\n- [basePen] Raise ``MissingComponentError`` instead of bare ``KeyError`` when a\\n  referenced component is missing (#2145).\\n\\n4.18.2 (released 2020-12-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [COLRv1] Implemented ``PaintTranslate`` paint format (#2129).\\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed unbound local variable error (#1787).\\n- [otlLib] Don't crash when creating OpenType class definitions if some glyphs\\n  occur more than once (#2125).\\n\\n4.18.1 (released 2020-12-09)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Speed optimization for ``LayerV1ListBuilder`` (#2119).\\n- [mutator] Fixed missing tab in ``interpolate_cff2_metrics`` (0957dc7a).\\n\\n4.18.0 (released 2020-12-04)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [COLRv1] Update to latest draft: added ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew`` (#2118).\\n- [woff2] Support new ``brotlicffi`` bindings for PyPy (#2117).\\n- [glifLib] Added ``expectContentsFile`` parameter to ``GlyphSet``, for use when\\n  reading existing UFOs, to comply with the specification stating that a\\n  ``contents.plist`` file must exist in a glyph set (#2114).\\n- [subset] Allow ``LangSys`` tags in ``--layout-scripts`` option (#2112). For example:\\n  ``--layout-scripts=arab.dflt,arab.URD,latn``; this will keep ``DefaultLangSys``\\n  and ``URD`` language for ``arab`` script, and all languages for ``latn`` script.\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow UFOs to be checked; report open paths, non existant\\n  glyphs; add a ``--json`` option to produce a machine-readable list of\\n  incompatibilities\\n- [pens] Added ``QuartzPen`` to create ``CGPath`` from glyph outlines on macOS.\\n  Requires pyobjc (#2107).\\n- [feaLib] You can export ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING=1`` to enable feature file\\n  debugging info stored in ``Debg`` table (#2106).\\n- [otlLib] Build more efficient format 1 and format 2 contextual lookups whenever\\n  possible (#2101).\\n\\n4.17.1 (released 2020-11-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0 when building COLR v0 table; when color\\n  layers are stored in UFO lib plist, we can't distinguish tuples from lists so\\n  we need to accept either types (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).\\n\\n4.17.0 (released 2020-11-12)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft ``COLR`` v1 spec (#2092).\\n- [svgLib] Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not separated\\n  by space or comma (#2094).\\n- [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing', if the default glyph is\\n  not empty (#2082).\\n- [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup location for ``Debg`` if ``Builder.buildLookups_``\\n  has cooperated (#2065, #2067).\\n- [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).\\n- [varLib] Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).\\n- Add HashPointPen adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of a glyph\\n  can be computed, which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).\\n\\n4.16.1 (released 2020-10-05)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.instancer] Fixed ``TypeError`` exception when instantiating a VF with\\n  a GSUB table 1.1 in which ``FeatureVariations`` attribute is present but set to\\n  ``None`` -- indicating that optional ``FeatureVariations`` is missing (#2077).\\n- [glifLib] Make ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of the ``point`` element required\\n  even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful ``GlifLibError``\\n  message when that happens (#2075).\\n\\n4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [removeOverlaps] Added new module and ``removeOverlaps`` function that merges\\n  overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the\\n  `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.\\n  Note that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).\\n- [varLib.instancer] Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.\\n  The ``overlap`` option in ``instantiateVariableFont`` now takes an ``OverlapMode``\\n  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS, 1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2: REMOVE.\\n  The latter is equivalent to calling ``removeOverlaps`` on the generated static\\n  instance. The option continues to accept ``bool`` value for backward compatibility.\\n\\n\\n4.15.0 (released 2020-09-21)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [plistlib] Added typing annotations to plistlib module. Set up mypy static\\n  typechecker to run automatically on CI (#2061).\\n- [ttLib] Implement private ``Debg`` table, a reverse-DNS namespaced JSON dict.\\n- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the ``Debg`` table with the original\\n  lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination (if any),\\n  and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx output for\\n  a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).\\n- [sfnt] Disabled checksum checking by default in ``SFNTReader`` (#2058).\\n- [Docs] Document ``mtiLib`` module (#2027).\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour node count and operation type\\n  of each node (#2054).\\n- [ttLib] Added API to register custom table packer/unpacker classes (#2055).\\n\\n4.14.0 (released 2020-08-19)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).\\n- [Docs] Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).\\n- [ttLib] Fixed 21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation (#2044,\\n  #2045).\\n- [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point (81d0042a).\\n- [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether the\\n  optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).\\n- [Snippets] Added snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF (#2030).\\n- [otlLib] Generate GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where appropriate\\n  (#2016).\\n\\n4.13.0 (released 2020-07-10)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib; refactored\\n  some common code (#2004, #2007).\\n- [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).\\n- [glifLib] Fixed bug with some UFO .glif filenames clashing on case-insensitive\\n  filesystems (#2001, #2002).\\n- [colorLib] Updated COLRv1 implementation following changes in the draft spec:\\n  (#2008, googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec#24).\\n\\n4.12.1 (released 2020-06-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed error in ``addMultilingualName`` with one-character names.\\n  Only attempt to recovered malformed UTF-16 data from a ``bytes`` string,\\n  not from unicode ``str`` (#1997, #1998).\\n\\n4.12.0 (released 2020-06-09)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otlLib/varLib] Ensure that the ``AxisNameID`` in the ``STAT`` and ``fvar``\\n  tables is grater than 255 as per OpenType spec (#1985, #1986).\\n- [docs] Document more modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``filenames``,\\n  ``fixedTools``, ``intTools``, ``loggingTools``, ``macCreatorType``, ``macRes``,\\n  ``plistlib`` (#1981).\\n- [OS/2] Don't calculate whole sets of unicode codepoints, use faster and more memory\\n  efficient ranges and bisect lookups (#1984).\\n- [voltLib] Support writing back abstract syntax tree as VOLT data (#1983).\\n- [voltLib] Accept DO_NOT_TOUCH_CMAP keyword (#1987).\\n- [subset/merge] Fixed a namespace clash involving a private helper class (#1955).\\n\\n4.11.0 (released 2020-05-28)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Introduced ``includeDir`` parameter on Parser and IncludingLexer to\\n  explicitly specify the directory to search when ``include()`` statements are\\n  encountered (#1973).\\n- [ufoLib] Silently delete duplicate glyphs within the same kerning group when reading\\n  groups (#1970).\\n- [ttLib] Set version of COLR table when decompiling COLRv1 (commit 9d8a7e2).\\n\\n4.10.2 (released 2020-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [sfnt] Fixed ``NameError: SimpleNamespace`` while reading TTC header. The regression\\n  was introduced with 4.10.1 after removing ``py23`` star import.\\n\\n4.10.1 (released 2020-05-19)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [sfnt] Make ``SFNTReader`` pickleable even when TTFont is loaded with lazy=True\\n  option and thus keeps a reference to an external file (#1962, #1967).\\n- [feaLib.ast] Restore backward compatibility (broken in 4.10 with #1905) for\\n  ``ChainContextPosStatement`` and ``ChainContextSubstStatement`` classes.\\n  Make them accept either list of lookups or list of lists of lookups (#1961).\\n- [docs] Document some modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``arrayTools``,\\n  ``bezierTools`` ``cliTools`` and ``eexec`` (#1956).\\n- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Fixed ``findMultilingualName()`` when name record's ``string`` is\\n  encoded as bytes sequence (#1963).\\n\\n4.10.0 (released 2020-05-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Allow feature variations to be active across the entire space (#1957).\\n- [ufoLib] Added support for ``formatVersionMinor`` in UFO's ``fontinfo.plist`` and for\\n  ``formatMinor`` attribute in GLIF file as discussed in unified-font-object/ufo-spec#78.\\n  No changes in reading or writing UFOs until an upcoming (non-0) minor update of the\\n  UFO specification is published (#1786).\\n- [merge] Fixed merging fonts with different versions of ``OS/2`` table (#1865, #1952).\\n- [subset] Fixed ``AttributeError`` while subsetting ``ContextSubst`` and ``ContextPos``\\n  Format 3 subtable (#1879, #1944).\\n- [ttLib.table._m_e_t_a] if data happens to be ascii, emit comment in TTX (#1938).\\n- [feaLib] Support multiple lookups per glyph position (#1905).\\n- [psCharStrings] Use inheritance to avoid repeated code in initializer (#1932).\\n- [Doc] Improved documentation for the following modules: ``afmLib`` (#1933), ``agl``\\n  (#1934), ``cffLib`` (#1935), ``cu2qu`` (#1937), ``encodings`` (#1940), ``feaLib``\\n  (#1941), ``merge`` (#1949).\\n- [Doc] Split off developer-centric info to new page, making front page of docs more\\n  user-focused.

The subsetter no longer drops\\n  FeatureVariationRecords that have empty substitutions as that will keep the search\\n  going and thus change the logic. It will only drop empty records that occur at the\\n  end of the FeatureVariationRecords array (#1881).\\n- [subset] Remove FeatureVariations table and downgrade GSUB/GPOS to version 0x10000\\n  when FeatureVariations contain no FeatureVariationRecords after subsetting (#1903).\\n- [agl] Add support for legacy Adobe Glyph List of glyph names in ``fontTools.agl``\\n  (#1895).\\n- [feaLib] Ignore superfluous script statements (#1883).\\n- [feaLib] Hide traceback by default on ``fonttools feaLib`` command line.\\n  Use ``--traceback`` option to show (#1898).\\n- [feaLib] Check lookup index in chaining sub/pos lookups and print better error\\n  message (#1896, #1897).\\n- [feaLib] Fix building chained alt substitutions (#1902).\\n- [Doc] Included all fontTools modules in the sphinx-generated documentation, and\\n  published it to ReadTheDocs for continuous documentation of the fontTools project\\n  (#1333). Check it out at https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/. Thanks to Chris Simpkins!\\n- [transform] The ``Transform`` class is now subclass of ``typing.NamedTuple``. No\\n  change in functionality (#1904).\\n\\n\\n4.8.1 (released 2020-04-17)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Fixed ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' has no attribute 'getAlternateGlyphs'``\\n  when ``aalt`` feature references a chain contextual substitution lookup\\n  (googlefonts/fontmake#648, #1878).\\n\\n4.8.0 (released 2020-04-16)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] If Parser is initialized without a ``glyphNames`` parameter, it cannot\\n  distinguish between a glyph name containing an hyphen, or a range of glyph names;\\n  instead of raising an error, it now interprets them as literal glyph names, while\\n  also outputting a logging warning to alert user about the ambiguity (#1768, #1870).\\n- [feaLib] When serializing AST to string, emit spaces around hyphens that denote\\n  ranges. Also, fixed an issue with CID ranges when round-tripping AST->string->AST\\n  (#1872).\\n- [Snippets/otf2ttf] In otf2ttf.py script update LSB in hmtx to match xMin (#1873).\\n- [colorLib] Added experimental support for building ``COLR`` v1 tables as per\\n  the `colr-gradients-spec <https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/blob/main/colr-gradients-spec.md>`__\\n  draft proposal. **NOTE**: both the API and the XML dump of ``COLR`` v1 are\\n  susceptible to change while the proposal is being discussed and formalized (#1822).\\n\\n4.7.0 (released 2020-04-03)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [cu2qu] Added ``fontTools.cu2qu`` package, imported from the original\\n  `cu2qu <https://github.com/googlefonts/cu2qu>`__ project. The ``cu2qu.pens`` module\\n  was moved to ``fontTools.pens.cu2quPen``. The optional cu2qu extension module\\n  can be compiled by installing `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__ before installing\\n  fonttools from source (i.e. git repo or sdist tarball). The wheel package that\\n  is published on PyPI (i.e. the one ``pip`` downloads, unless ``--no-binary``\\n  option is used), will continue to be pure-Python for now (#1868).\\n\\n4.6.0 (released 2020-03-24)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Added support for building variable ``BASE`` table version 1.1 (#1858).\\n- [CPAL] Added ``fromRGBA`` method to ``Color`` class (#1861).\\n\\n\\n4.5.0 (released 2020-03-20)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Added ``add{Axis,Source,Instance,Rule}Descriptor`` methods to\\n  ``DesignSpaceDocument`` class, to initialize new descriptor objects using keyword\\n  arguments, and at the same time append them to the current document (#1860).\\n- [unicodedata] Update to Unicode 13.0 (#1859).\\n\\n4.4.3 (released 2020-03-13)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Always build ``gvar`` table for TrueType-flavored Variable Fonts,\\n  even if it contains no variation data. The table is required according to\\n  the OpenType spec (#1855, #1857).\\n\\n4.4.2 (released 2020-03-12)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [ttx] Annotate ``LookupFlag`` in XML dump with comment explaining what bits\\n  are set and what they mean (#1850).\\n- [feaLib] Added more descriptive message to ``IncludedFeaNotFound`` error (#1842).\\n\\n4.4.1 (released 2020-02-26)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [woff2] Skip normalizing ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables if these are missing from\\n  a font (e.g. in NotoColorEmoji using ``CBDT/CBLC`` tables).\\n- [timeTools] Use non-localized date parsing in ``timestampFromString``, to fix\\n  error when non-English ``LC_TIME`` locale is set (#1838, #1839).\\n- [fontBuilder] Make sure the CFF table generated by fontBuilder can be used by varLib\\n  without having to compile and decompile the table first. This was breaking in\\n  converting the CFF table to CFF2 due to some unset attributes (#1836).\\n\\n4.4.0 (released 2020-02-18)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Added ``fontTools.colorLib.builder`` module, initially with ``buildCOLR``\\n  and ``buildCPAL`` public functions. More color font formats will follow (#1827).\\n- [fontBuilder] Added ``setupCOLR`` and ``setupCPAL`` methods (#1826).\\n- [ttGlyphPen] Quantize ``GlyphComponent.transform`` floats to ``F2Dot14`` to fix\\n  round-trip issue when computing bounding boxes of transformed components (#1830).\\n- [glyf] If a component uses reference points (``firstPt`` and ``secondPt``) for\\n  alignment (instead of X and Y offsets), compute the effective translation offset\\n  *after* having applied any transform (#1831).\\n- [glyf] When all glyphs have zero contours, compile ``glyf`` table data as a single\\n  null byte in order to pass validation by OTS and Windows (#1829).\\n- [feaLib] Parsing feature code now ensures that referenced glyph names are part of\\n  the known glyph set, unless a glyph set was not provided.\\n- [varLib] When filling in the default axis value for a missing location of a source or\\n  instance, correctly map the value forward.\\n- [varLib] The avar table can now contain mapping output values that are greater than\\n  OR EQUAL to the preceeding value, as the avar specification allows this.\\n- [varLib] The errors of the module are now ordered hierarchically below VarLibError.\\n  See #1821.\\n\\n4.3.0 (released 2020-02-03)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [EBLC/CBLC] Fixed incorrect padding length calculation for Format 3 IndexSubTable\\n  (#1817, #1818).\\n- [varLib] Fixed error when merging OTL tables and TTFonts were loaded as ``lazy=True``\\n  (#1808, #1809).\\n- [varLib] Allow to use master fonts containing ``CFF2`` table when building VF (#1816).\\n- [ttLib] Make ``recalcBBoxes`` option work also with ``CFF2`` table (#1816).\\n- [feaLib] Don't reset ``lookupflag`` in lookups defined inside feature blocks.\\n  They will now inherit the current ``lookupflag`` of the feature. This is what\\n  Adobe ``makeotf`` also does in this case (#1815).\\n- [feaLib] Fixed bug with mixed single/multiple substitutions. If a single substitution\\n  involved a glyph class, we were incorrectly using only the first glyph in the class\\n  (#1814).\\n\\n4.2.5 (released 2020-01-29)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Do not fail on duplicate multiple substitutions, only warn (#1811).\\n- [subset] Optimize SinglePos subtables to Format 1 if all ValueRecords are the same\\n  (#1802).\\n\\n4.2.4 (released 2020-01-09)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [unicodedata] Update RTL_SCRIPTS for Unicode 11 and 12.\\n\\n4.2.3 (released 2020-01-07)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [otTables] Fixed bug when splitting `MarkBasePos` subtables as offsets overflow.\\n  The mark class values in the split subtable were not being updated, leading to\\n  invalid mark-base attachments (#1797, googlefonts/noto-source#145).\\n- [feaLib] Only log a warning instead of error when features contain duplicate\\n  substitutions (#1767).\\n- [glifLib] Strip XML comments when parsing with lxml (#1784, #1785).\\n\\n4.2.2 (released 2019-12-12)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fixed issue with subsetting FeatureVariations table when the index\\n  of features changes as features get dropped. The feature index need to be\\n  remapped to point to index of the remaining features (#1777, #1782).\\n- [fontBuilder] Added `addFeatureVariations` method to `FontBuilder` class. This\\n  is a shorthand for calling `featureVars.addFeatureVariations` on the builder's\\n  TTFont object (#1781).\\n- [glyf] Fixed the flags bug in glyph.drawPoints() like we did for glyph.draw()\\n  (#1771, #1774).\\n\\n4.2.1 (released 2019-12-06)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [glyf] Use the ``flagOnCurve`` bit mask in ``glyph.draw()``, so that we ignore\\n  the ``overlap`` flag that may be set when instantiating variable fonts (#1771).\\n\\n4.2.0 (released 2019-11-28)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [pens] Added the following pens:\\n\\n  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPen``: filter pen that rounds coordinates and components'\\n    offsets to integer;\\n  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPointPen``: like the above, but using PointPen protocol.\\n  * ``filterPen.FilterPointPen``: base class for filter point pens;\\n  * ``transformPen.TransformPointPen``: filter point pen to apply affine transform;\\n  * ``recordingPen.RecordingPointPen``: records and replays point-pen commands.\\n\\n- [ttGlyphPen] Always round float coordinates and component offsets to integers\\n  (#1763).\\n- [ufoLib] When converting kerning groups from UFO2 to UFO3, avoid confusing\\n  groups with the same name as one of the glyphs (#1761, #1762,\\n  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#98).\\n\\n4.1.0 (released 2019-11-18)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [instancer] Implemented restricting axis ranges (level 3 partial instancing).\\n  You can now pass ``{axis_tag: (min, max)}`` tuples as input to the\\n  ``instantiateVariableFont`` function. Note that changing the default axis\\n  position is not supported yet. The command-line script also accepts axis ranges\\n  in the form of colon-separated float values, e.g. ``wght=400:700`` (#1753, #1537).\\n- [instancer] Never drop STAT ``DesignAxis`` records, but only prune out-of-range\\n  ``AxisValue`` records.\\n- [otBase/otTables] Enforce that VarStore.RegionAxisCount == fvar.axisCount, even\\n  when regions list is empty to appease OTS < v8.0 (#1752).\\n- [designspaceLib] Defined new ``processing`` attribute for ``<rules>`` element,\\n  with values \\\"first\\\" or \\\"last\\\", plus other editorial changes to DesignSpace\\n  specification. Bumped format version to 4.1 (#1750).\\n- [varLib] Improved error message when masters' glyph orders do not match (#1758,\\n  #1759).\\n- [featureVars] Allow to specify custom feature tag in ``addFeatureVariations``;\\n  allow said feature to already exist, in which case we append new lookup indices\\n  to existing features. Implemented ``<rules>`` attribute ``processing`` according to\\n  DesignSpace specification update in #1750. Depending on this flag, we generate\\n  either an 'rvrn' (always processed first) or a 'rclt' feature (follows lookup order,\\n  therefore last) (#1747, #1625, #1371).\\n- [ttCollection] Added support for context manager auto-closing via ``with`` statement\\n  like with ``TTFont`` (#1751).\\n- [unicodedata] Require unicodedata2 >= 12.1.0.\\n- [py2.py3] Removed yet more PY2 vestiges (#1743).\\n- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed issue when comparing NameRecords with different string types (#1742).\\n- [fixedTools] Changed ``fixedToFloat`` to not do any rounding but simply return\\n  ``value / (1 << precisionBits)``. Added ``floatToFixedToStr`` and\\n  ``strToFixedToFloat`` functions to be used when loading from or dumping to XML.\\n  Fixed values (e.g. fvar axes and instance coordinates, avar mappings, etc.) are\\n  are now stored as un-rounded decimal floats upon decompiling (#1740, #737).\\n- [feaLib] Fixed handling of multiple ``LigatureCaret`` statements for the same glyph.\\n  Only the first rule per glyph is used, additional ones are ignored (#1733).\\n\\n4.0.2 (released 2019-09-26)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [voltLib] Added support for ``ALL`` and ``NONE`` in ``PROCESS_MARKS`` (#1732).\\n- [Silf] Fixed issue in ``Silf`` table compilation and decompilation regarding str vs\\n  bytes in python3 (#1728).\\n- [merge] Handle duplicate glyph names better: instead of appending font index to\\n  all glyph names, use similar code like we use in ``post`` and ``CFF`` tables (#1729).\\n\\n4.0.1 (released 2019-09-11)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [otTables] Support fixing offset overflows in ``MultipleSubst`` lookup subtables\\n  (#1706).\\n- [subset] Prune empty strikes in ``EBDT`` and ``CBDT`` table data (#1698, #1633).\\n- [pens] Fixed issue in ``PointToSegmentPen`` when last point of closed contour has\\n  same coordinates as the starting point and was incorrectly dropped (#1720).\\n- [Graphite] Fixed ``Sill`` table output to pass OTS (#1705).\\n- [name] Added ``removeNames`` method to ``table__n_a_m_e`` class (#1719).\\n- [ttLib] Added aliases for renamed entries ``ascender`` and ``descender`` in\\n  ``hhea`` table (#1715).\\n\\n4.0.0 (released 2019-08-22)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- NOTE: The v4.x version series only supports Python 3.6 or greater. You can keep\\n  using fonttools 3.x if you need support for Python 2.\\n- [py23] Removed all the python2-only code since it is no longer reachable, thus\\n  unused; only the Python3 symbols were kept, but these are no-op. The module is now\\n  DEPRECATED and will removed in the future.\\n- [ttLib] Fixed UnboundLocalError for empty loca/glyph tables (#1680). Also, allow\\n  the glyf table to be incomplete when dumping to XML (#1681).\\n- [varLib.models] Fixed KeyError while sorting masters and there are no on-axis for\\n  a given axis (38a8eb0e).\\n- [cffLib] Make sure glyph names are unique (#1699).\\n- [feaLib] Fix feature parser to correctly handle octal numbers (#1700).\\n\\n\\\\... see `here <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/main/NEWS.rst>`__ for earlier changes\\n\",\n",

Acknowledgements and Thanks\\n\\n\\n1. Licensing\\n============\\nBSD license.  See ``LICENSE.txt`` for details.\\n\\n\\n2. Installation\\n===============\\n\\nIn most cases, pip install reportlab`` will do the job.\\n\\n\\n2.1 General prerequisites\\n--------------------------\\nYou need to have installed Python (versions 2.7 or >=3.6) and reportlab\\nand ideally PIL or Pillow with Freetype support; more notes on prerequisites\\nfollow below.\\n\\n2.2. Where to get the code\\n------------------------------------------\\nLatest sources are available from ReportLab's\\nopen source download area::\\n\\n    https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-pulic/rlPyCairo\\n\\nYou can obtain the latest code from our Mercurial repository with::\\n\\n    hg clone https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-public/rlPyCairo\\n\\nAll released packages are available from our pypi at\\n\\n\\thttps://www.reportlab.com/pypi/\\n\\n\\nMain releases are also available from the Python Package Index:\\n\\n    https://pypi.python.org/\\n\\nA mirror only repository is available for git users at\\n\\n\\thttps://github.com/MrBitBucket/rlPyCairo-mirror\\n\\nplease do not use this for issue reporting etc; use the mail list at\\n\\n    https://pairlist2.pair.net/mailman/listinfo/reportlab-users\\n\\n\\n3. Prerequisites / Dependencies\\n===============================\\nThis works with Python versions 2.7 or >=3.6. Older versions are available\\ngoing back to Python 1.5 or thereabouts.\\n\\nThere are no absolute prerequisites beyond the Python\\nstandard library; but the Python Imaging Library (PIL or Pillow)\\nis needed to produce images with this package.\\n\\n4. Documentation\\n================\\nThere is no documentation other than that provided in the reportlab package\\nabout the standard renderPM renderer. This package is intended as an\\nalternative to the lgpl_libart based backend reportlab.graphics._renderPM.\\n\\nTo enable this backend the reportlab.rl_config.renderPMBackend should be set\\nto the string 'rlPyCairo'. Use any of the methods outlined in\\nreportlab/rl_config.py to accomplish this.\\n\\n5. Test suite\\n=============\\nTests are in the ``reportlab/tests/`` directory.  They can be executed by cd'ing into the\\ndirectory and executing ``python runAll.py`` with an envinment variable\\nset as RL_renderPMBackend=rlPyCairo. Obviously you need to have rlPyCairo\\ninstalled.\\n\\n6. Acknowledgements and Thanks\\n==============================\\nClaude Paroz for failing examples of the base backend.\\n\",\n",

You can remove it from your requirements file if none of your other\\n  requirements require html5lib.\\n\\n  This means Bleach will now work fine with other libraries that depend on\\n  html5lib regardless of what version of html5lib they require. (#386)\\n\\n**Bug fixes**\\n\\n* Fixed tags getting added when using clean or linkify. This was a\\n  long-standing regression from the Bleach 2.0 rewrite. (#280, #392)\\n\\n* Fixed ``<isindex>`` getting replaced with a string. Now it gets escaped or\\n  stripped depending on whether it's in the allowed tags or not.

Using character entities, it\\n  was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not\\n  allowed that would slide through unsanitized.\\n\\n  This security issue was introduced in Bleach 2.1.

Check the comments on that\\n  issue for ways to alleviate the issue if you can't upgrade to Bleach 2.1.\\n\\n\\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\\n\\n* Redid versioning. ``bleach.VERSION`` is no longer available. Use the string\\n  version at ``bleach.__version__`` and parse it with\\n  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. (#307)\\n\\n* clean, linkify: linkify and clean should only accept text types; thank you,\\n  Janusz!

(#206)\\n\\n* Removed support for Python 3.2. (#224)\\n\\n* Bleach no longer supports html5lib < 0.99999999 (8 9s).\\n\\n  This version is a rewrite to use the new sanitizing API since the old\\n  one was dropped in html5lib 0.99999999 (8 9s).\\n\\n  If you're using 0.9999999 (7 9s) upgrade to 0.99999999 (8 9s) or higher.\\n\\n  If you're using 1.0b8 (equivalent to 0.9999999 (7 9s)), upgrade to 1.0b9\\n  (equivalent to 0.99999999 (8 9s)) or higher.\\n\\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends were rewritten\\n\\n  ``clean`` was reimplemented as an html5lib filter and happens at a different\\n  step in the HTML parsing -> traversing -> serializing process. Because of\\n  that, there are some differences in clean's output as compared with previous\\n  versions.\\n\\n  Amongst other things, this version will add end tags even if the tag in\\n  question is to be escaped.\\n\\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends attribute callables now take three arguments:\\n  tag, attribute name and attribute value. Previously they only took attribute\\n  name and attribute value.\\n\\n  All attribute callables will need to be updated.\\n\\n* ``bleach.linkify`` was rewritten\\n\\n  ``linkify`` was reimplemented as an html5lib Filter. As such, it no longer\\n  accepts a ``tokenizer`` argument.\\n\\n  The callback functions for adjusting link attributes now takes a namespaced\\n  attribute.\\n\\n  Previously you'd do something like this::\\n\\n      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):\\n          if not attrs.get('href', '').startswith('http:', 'https:')):\\n              return None\\n          return attrs\\n\\n  Now it's more like this::\\n\\n      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):\\n          if not attrs.get((None, u'href'), u'').startswith(('http:', 'https:')):\\n              #            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n              return None\\n          return attrs\\n\\n  Further, you need to make sure you're always using unicode values. If you\\n  don't then html5lib will raise an assertion error that the value is not\\n  unicode.\\n\\n  All linkify filters will need to be updated.\\n\\n* ``bleach.linkify`` and friends had a ``skip_pre`` argument--that's been\\n  replaced with a more general ``skip_tags`` argument.\\n\\n  Before, you might do::\\n\\n      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_pre=True)\\n\\n  The equivalent with Bleach 2.0 is::\\n\\n      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_tags=['pre'])\\n\\n  You can skip other tags, too, like ``style`` or ``script`` or other places\\n  where you don't want linkification happening.\\n\\n  All uses of linkify that use ``skip_pre`` will need to be updated.\\n\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* Supports Python 3.6.\\n\\n* Supports html5lib >= 0.99999999 (8 9s).\\n\\n* There's a ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` class that you can instantiate with your\\n  favorite clean settings for easy reuse.\\n\\n* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.Linker`` class that you can instantiate with your\\n  favorite linkify settings for easy reuse.\\n\\n* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.LinkifyFilter`` which is an htm5lib filter that\\n  you can pass as a filter to ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` allowing you to clean\\n  and linkify in one pass.\\n\\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends can now take a callable as an attributes arg value.\\n\\n* Tons of bug fixes.\\n\\n* Cleaned up tests.\\n\\n* Documentation fixes.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.5 (November 4th, 2016)\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n**Security fixes**\\n\\n* None\\n\\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\\n\\n* clean: The list of ``ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS`` now defaults to http, https and\\n  mailto.\\n\\n  Previously it was a long list of protocols something like ed2k, ftp, http,\\n  https, irc, mailto, news, gopher, nntp, telnet, webcal, xmpp, callto, feed,\\n  urn, aim, rsync, tag, ssh, sftp, rtsp, afs, data. (#149)\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* clean: Added ``protocols`` to arguments list to let you override the list of\\n  allowed protocols. Thank you, Andreas Malecki! (#149)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix a bug involving periods at the end of an email address. Thank you,\\n  Lorenz Schori! (#219)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix linkification of non-ascii ports. Thank you Alexandre, Macabies!\\n  (#207)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix linkify inappropriately removing node tails when dropping nodes.\\n  (#132)\\n\\n* Fixed a test that failed periodically. (#161)\\n\\n* Switched from nose to py.test. (#204)\\n\\n* Add test matrix for all supported Python and html5lib versions. (#230)\\n\\n* Limit to html5lib ``>=0.999,!=0.9999,!=0.99999,<0.99999999`` because 0.9999\\n  and 0.99999 are busted.\\n\\n* Add support for ``python setup.py test``. (#97)\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4.3 (May 23rd, 2016)\\n------------------------------\\n\\n**Security fixes**\\n\\n* None\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* Limit to html5lib ``>=0.999,<0.99999999`` because of impending change to\\n  sanitizer api. #195\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4.2 (September 11, 2015)\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* linkify: Fix hang in linkify with ``parse_email=True``. (#124)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix crash in linkify when removing a link that is a first-child. (#136)\\n\\n* Updated TLDs.\\n\\n* linkify: Don't remove exterior brackets when linkifying. (#146)\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4.1 (December 15, 2014)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* Consistent order of attributes in output.\\n\\n* Python 3.4 support.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4 (January 12, 2014)\\n------------------------------\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* linkify: Update linkify to use etree type Treewalker instead of simpletree.\\n\\n* Updated html5lib to version ``>=0.999``.\\n\\n* Update all code to be compatible with Python 3 and 2 using six.\\n\\n* Switch to Apache License.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.3\\n-----------\\n\\n* Used by Python 3-only fork.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.2.2 (May 18, 2013)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n* Pin html5lib to version 0.95 for now due to major API break.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.2.1 (February 19, 2013)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n* ``clean()`` no longer considers ``feed:`` an acceptable protocol due to\\n  inconsistencies in browser behavior.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.2 (January 28, 2013)\\n------------------------------\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` has changed considerably. Many keyword arguments have been\\n  replaced with a single callbacks list. Please see the documentation for more\\n  information.\\n\\n* Bleach will no longer consider unacceptable protocols when linkifying.\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` now takes a tokenizer argument that allows it to skip\\n  sanitization.\\n\\n* ``delinkify()`` is gone.\\n\\n* Removed exception handling from ``_render``. ``clean()`` and ``linkify()`` may\\n  now throw.\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` correctly ignores case for protocols and domain names.\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` correctly handles markup within an <a> tag.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.5\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.4\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.3 (July 10, 2012)\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n* Fix parsing bare URLs when parse_email=True.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.2 (June 1, 2012)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n* Fix hang in style attribute sanitizer. (#61)\\n\\n* Allow ``/`` in style attribute values.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.1 (February 17, 2012)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n* Fix tokenizer for html5lib 0.9.5.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.0 (October 24, 2011)\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` now understands port numbers.

In some cases,\\nwe also note alternative representations which do not require this package.\\n\\n## Install\\n\\n```bash\\npip install annotated-types\\n```\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom annotated_types import Gt, Len, Predicate\\n\\nclass MyClass:\\n    age: Annotated[int, Gt(18)]                         # Valid: 19, 20, ...\\n                                                        # Invalid: 17, 18, \\\"19\\\", 19.0, ...\\n    factors: list[Annotated[int, Predicate(is_prime)]]  # Valid: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...\\n                                                        # Invalid: 4, 8, -2, 5.0, \\\"prime\\\", ...\\n\\n    my_list: Annotated[list[int], Len(0, 10)]           # Valid: [], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\\n                                                        # Invalid: (1, 2), [\\\"abc\\\"], [0] * 20\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n_While `annotated-types` avoids runtime checks for performance, users should not\\nconstruct invalid combinations such as `MultipleOf(\\\"non-numeric\\\")` or `Annotated[int, Len(3)]`.\\nDownstream implementors may choose to raise an error, emit a warning, silently ignore\\na metadata item, etc., if the metadata objects described below are used with an\\nincompatible type - or for any other reason!_\\n\\n### Gt, Ge, Lt, Le\\n\\nExpress inclusive and/or exclusive bounds on orderable values - which may be numbers,\\ndates, times, strings, sets, etc. Note that the boundary value need not be of the\\nsame type that was annotated, so long as they can be compared: `Annotated[int, Gt(1.5)]`\\nis fine, for example, and implies that the value is an integer x such that `x > 1.5`.\\n\\nWe suggest that implementors may also interpret `functools.partial(operator.le, 1.5)`\\nas being equivalent to `Gt(1.5)`, for users who wish to avoid a runtime dependency on\\nthe `annotated-types` package.\\n\\nTo be explicit, these types have the following meanings:\\n\\n* `Gt(x)` - value must be \\\"Greater Than\\\" `x` - equivalent to exclusive minimum\\n* `Ge(x)` - value must be \\\"Greater than or Equal\\\" to `x` - equivalent to inclusive minimum\\n* `Lt(x)` - value must be \\\"Less Than\\\" `x` - equivalent to exclusive maximum\\n* `Le(x)` - value must be \\\"Less than or Equal\\\" to `x` - equivalent to inclusive maximum\\n\\n### Interval\\n\\n`Interval(gt, ge, lt, le)` allows you to specify an upper and lower bound with a single\\nmetadata object. `None` attributes should be ignored, and non-`None` attributes\\ntreated as per the single bounds above.\\n\\n### MultipleOf\\n\\n`MultipleOf(multiple_of=x)` might be interpreted in two ways:\\n\\n1. Python semantics, implying `value % multiple_of == 0`, or\\n2. [JSONschema semantics](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.2.1),\\n   where `int(value / multiple_of) == value / multiple_of`.\\n\\nWe encourage users to be aware of these two common interpretations and their\\ndistinct behaviours, especially since very large or non-integer numbers make\\nit easy to cause silent data corruption due to floating-point imprecision.\\n\\nWe encourage libraries to carefully document which interpretation they implement.\\n\\n### MinLen, MaxLen, Len\\n\\n`Len()` implies that `min_length <= len(value) <= max_length` - lower and upper bounds are inclusive.\\n\\nAs well as `Len()` which can optionally include upper and lower bounds, we also\\nprovide `MinLen(x)` and `MaxLen(y)` which are equivalent to `Len(min_length=x)`\\nand `Len(max_length=y)` respectively.\\n\\n`Len`, `MinLen`, and `MaxLen` may be used with any type which supports `len(value)`.\\n\\nExamples of usage:\\n\\n* `Annotated[list, MaxLen(10)]` (or `Annotated[list, Len(max_length=10))`) - list must have a length of 10 or less\\n* `Annotated[str, MaxLen(10)]` - string must have a length of 10 or less\\n* `Annotated[list, MinLen(3))` (or `Annotated[list, Len(min_length=3))`) - list must have a length of 3 or more\\n* `Annotated[list, Len(4, 6)]` - list must have a length of 4, 5, or 6\\n* `Annotated[list, Len(8, 8)]` - list must have a length of exactly 8\\n\\n#### Changed in v0.4.0\\n\\n* `min_inclusive` has been renamed to `min_length`, no change in meaning\\n* `max_exclusive` has been renamed to `max_length`, upper bound is now **inclusive** instead of **exclusive**\\n* The recommendation that slices are interpreted as `Len` has been removed due to ambiguity and different semantic\\n  meaning of the upper bound in slices vs. `Len`\\n\\nSee [issue #23](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types/issues/23) for discussion.\\n\\n### Timezone\\n\\n`Timezone` can be used with a `datetime` or a `time` to express which timezones\\nare allowed. `Annotated[datetime, Timezone(None)]` must be a naive datetime.\\n`Timezone[...]` ([literal ellipsis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis))\\nexpresses that any timezone-aware datetime is allowed. You may also pass a specific\\ntimezone string or [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#tzinfo-objects)\\nobject such as `Timezone(timezone.utc)` or `Timezone(\\\"Africa/Abidjan\\\")` to express that you only\\nallow a specific timezone, though we note that this is often a symptom of fragile design.\\n\\n#### Changed in v0.x.x\\n\\n* `Timezone` accepts [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#tzinfo-objects) objects instead of\\n  `timezone`, extending compatibility to [`zoneinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html) and third party libraries.\\n\\n### Unit\\n\\n`Unit(unit: str)` expresses that the annotated numeric value is the magnitude of\\na quantity with the specified unit. For example, `Annotated[float, Unit(\\\"m/s\\\")]`\\nwould be a float representing a velocity in meters per second.\\n\\nPlease note that `annotated_types` itself makes no attempt to parse or validate\\nthe unit string in any way. That is left entirely to downstream libraries,\\nsuch as [`pint`](https://pint.readthedocs.io) or\\n[`astropy.units`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/).\\n\\nAn example of how a library might use this metadata:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom annotated_types import Unit\\nfrom typing import Annotated, TypeVar, Callable, Any, get_origin, get_args\\n\\n# given a type annotated with a unit:\\nMeters = Annotated[float, Unit(\\\"m\\\")]\\n\\n\\n# you can cast the annotation to a specific unit type with any\\n# callable that accepts a string and returns the desired type\\nT = TypeVar(\\\"T\\\")\\ndef cast_unit(tp: Any, unit_cls: Callable[[str], T]) -> T | None:\\n    if get_origin(tp) is Annotated:\\n        for arg in get_args(tp):\\n            if isinstance(arg, Unit):\\n                return unit_cls(arg.unit)\\n    return None\\n\\n\\n# using `pint`\\nimport pint\\npint_unit = cast_unit(Meters, pint.Unit)\\n\\n\\n# using `astropy.units`\\nimport astropy.units as u\\nastropy_unit = cast_unit(Meters, u.Unit)\\n```\\n\\n### Predicate\\n\\n`Predicate(func: Callable)` expresses that `func(value)` is truthy for valid values.\\nUsers should prefer the statically inspectable metadata above, but if you need\\nthe full power and flexibility of arbitrary runtime predicates... here it is.\\n\\nFor some common constraints, we provide generic types:\\n\\n* `IsLower       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.islower)]`\\n* `IsUpper       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.isupper)]`\\n* `IsDigit       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.isdigit)]`\\n* `IsFinite      = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isfinite)]`\\n* `IsNotFinite   = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isfinite))]`\\n* `IsNan         = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isnan)]`\\n* `IsNotNan      = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isnan))]`\\n* `IsInfinite    = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isinf)]`\\n* `IsNotInfinite = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isinf))]`\\n\\nso that you can write e.g. `x: IsFinite[float] = 2.0` instead of the longer\\n(but exactly equivalent) `x: Annotated[float, Predicate(math.isfinite)] = 2.0`.\\n\\nSome libraries might have special logic to handle known or understandable predicates,\\nfor example by checking for `str.isdigit` and using its presence to both call custom\\nlogic to enforce digit-only strings, and customise some generated external schema.\\nUsers are therefore encouraged to avoid indirection like `lambda s: s.lower()`, in\\nfavor of introspectable methods such as `str.lower` or `re.compile(\\\"pattern\\\").search`.\\n\\nTo enable basic negation of commonly used predicates like `math.isnan` without introducing introspection that makes it impossible for implementers to introspect the predicate we provide a `Not` wrapper that simply negates the predicate in an introspectable manner. Several of the predicates listed above are created in this manner.\\n\\nWe do not specify what behaviour should be expected for predicates that raise\\nan exception.  For example `Annotated[int, Predicate(str.isdigit)]` might silently\\nskip invalid constraints, or statically raise an error; or it might try calling it\\nand then propagate or discard the resulting\\n`TypeError: descriptor 'isdigit' for 'str' objects doesn't apply to a 'int' object`\\nexception.  We encourage libraries to document the behaviour they choose.\\n\\n### Doc\\n\\n`doc()` can be used to add documentation information in `Annotated`, for function and method parameters, variables, class attributes, return types, and any place where `Annotated` can be used.\\n\\nIt expects a value that can be statically analyzed, as the main use case is for static analysis, editors, documentation generators, and similar tools.\\n\\nIt returns a `DocInfo` class with a single attribute `documentation` containing the value passed to `doc()`.\\n\\nThis is the early adopter's alternative form of the [`typing-doc` proposal](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/typing-doc/typing_doc.md).\\n\\n### Integrating downstream types with `GroupedMetadata`\\n\\nImplementers may choose to provide a convenience wrapper that groups multiple pieces of metadata.\\nThis can help reduce verbosity and cognitive overhead for users.\\nFor example, an implementer like Pydantic might provide a `Field` or `Meta` type that accepts keyword arguments and transforms these into low-level metadata:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\nfrom annotated_types import GroupedMetadata, Ge\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Field(GroupedMetadata):\\n    ge: int | None = None\\n    description: str | None = None\\n\\n    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[object]:\\n        # Iterating over a GroupedMetadata object should yield annotated-types\\n        # constraint metadata objects which describe it as fully as possible,\\n        # and may include other unknown objects too.\\n        if self.ge is not None:\\n            yield Ge(self.ge)\\n        if self.description is not None:\\n            yield Description(self.description)\\n```\\n\\nLibraries consuming annotated-types constraints should check for `GroupedMetadata` and unpack it by iterating over the object and treating the results as if they had been \\\"unpacked\\\" in the `Annotated` type.  The same logic should be applied to the [PEP 646 `Unpack` type](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/), so that `Annotated[T, Field(...)]`, `Annotated[T, Unpack[Field(...)]]` and `Annotated[T, *Field(...)]` are all treated consistently.\\n\\nLibraries consuming annotated-types should also ignore any metadata they do not recongize that came from unpacking a `GroupedMetadata`, just like they ignore unrecognized metadata in `Annotated` itself.\\n\\nOur own `annotated_types.Interval` class is a `GroupedMetadata` which unpacks itself into `Gt`, `Lt`, etc., so this is not an abstract concern.  Similarly, `annotated_types.Len` is a `GroupedMetadata` which unpacks itself into `MinLen` (optionally) and `MaxLen`.\\n\\n### Consuming metadata\\n\\nWe intend to not be prescriptive as to _how_ the metadata and constraints are used, but as an example of how one might parse constraints from types annotations see our [implementation in `test_main.py`](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types/blob/f59cf6d1b5255a0fe359b93896759a180bec30ae/tests/test_main.py#L94-L103).\\n\\nIt is up to the implementer to determine how this metadata is used.\\nYou could use the metadata for runtime type checking, for generating schemas or to generate example data, amongst other use cases.\\n\\n## Design & History\\n\\nThis package was designed at the PyCon 2022 sprints by the maintainers of Pydantic\\nand Hypothesis, with the goal of making it as easy as possible for end-users to\\nprovide more informative annotations for use by runtime libraries.\\n\\nIt is deliberately minimal, and following PEP-593 allows considerable downstream\\ndiscretion in what (if anything!) they choose to support. Nonetheless, we expect\\nthat staying simple and covering _only_ the most common use-cases will give users\\nand maintainers the best experience we can. If you'd like more constraints for your\\ntypes - follow our lead, by defining them and documenting them downstream!\\n\",\n",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\\n==========================\\n\\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\\n\\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\\nsoftware.\\n\\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\\n\\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\\nthe various releases.\\n\\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\\n\\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\\n    is \\\"not incompatible\\\" with the GPL.\\n\\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\\ndirection to make these releases possible.\\n\\n\\nB.

For details on this change and migration instructions, see the [release notes](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasehistory.html#namespace-migration) of version 0.9.0.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n[Documentation](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the Open Force Field Toolkit is hosted at [readthedocs](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable). Example notebooks are available in the `examples/` directory and also hosted on the [`Open Force Field`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/en/latest/examples.html) website.\\n\\n## How to cite\\n\\nPlease cite the OpenFF Toolkit using the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/13886754) of the [latest release](https://zenodo.org/record/13886754) or the version that was used. The BibTeX reference of the latest release can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13886754/export/bibtex).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThe Open Force Field Toolkit (`openff-toolkit`) is a Python toolkit, and supports Python 3.9 through 3.11.\\n\\n### Installing via Mamba/Conda\\n\\nDetailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).\\n\\n## Force Fields\\n\\nTwo major force field development efforts have been undertaken by the Open Force Field Initiative, with results hosted in separate repositories.\\n\\n* The [Open Force Fields repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields/), which features the [Parsley](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/) and [Sage](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.0.0-release/) force field lines. These are the Open Force Field Initiative's efforts toward building _new_ force fields. The initial parameters are taken from smirnoff99Frosst, but software and data produced by the Initiative's efforts have been used to refit parameter values and add new SMIRKS-based parameters.\\n* The [smirnoff99Frosst repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/), which is descended from AMBER's parm99 force field as well as Merck-Frosst's parm@frosst. This line of force fields does not aim to alter parameter values, but is instead a test of accurately converting an atom type-based force field to the SMIRNOFF format.\\n\\nForce fields from both of these packages are available in their respective GitHub repositories and also as conda packages. Tables detailing the individual file names/versions within these force field lines are in the README of each repository. By default, installing the Open Force Field toolkit using `conda` or the single-file toolkit installers will also install these conda packages. A [plugin architecture](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/blob/main/FAQ.md#how-can-i-distribute-my-own-force-fields-in-smirnoff-format) is provided for other force field developers to produce python/conda packages that can be imported by the Open Force Field Toolkit as well.\\n\\n# Toolkit features\\n\\n## The SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format\\n\\nThis repository provides tools for using the [SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) specification](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/), which currently supports an XML representation for force field definition files.\\n\\nBy convention, files containing [XML representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) of SMIRNOFF force fields carry `.offxml` extensions.\\n\\nExample SMIRNOFF `.offxml` force field definitions can be found in [`openff/toolkit/data/test_forcefields/`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/tree/main/openff/toolkit/data/test_forcefields). These force fields are for testing only, and we neither record versions of these files, nor do we guarantee their correctness or completeness.\\n\\n### Working with SMIRNOFF parameter sets\\n\\nSMIRNOFF force fields can be parsed by the `ForceField` class, which offers methods including `create_openmm_system` for exporting to OpenMM and `create_interchange` for exporting to other formats (GROMACS, Amber, LAMMPS) via [Interchange](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/interchange).\\n\\n```python\\n# Load a molecule into the OpenFF Molecule object\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\nfrom openff.toolkit.utils import get_data_file_path\\nsdf_file_path = get_data_file_path('molecules/ethanol.sdf')\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_file(sdf_file_path)\\n\\n# Create an OpenFF Topology object from the molecule\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Topology\\ntopology = Topology.from_molecules(molecule)\\n\\n# Load the latest OpenFF force field release: version 2.1.0, codename \\\"Sage\\\"\\nfrom openff.toolkit import ForceField\\nforcefield = ForceField('openff-2.1.0.offxml')\\n\\n# Create an OpenMM system representing the molecule with SMIRNOFF-applied parameters\\nopenmm_system = forcefield.create_openmm_system(topology)\\n\\n# Create an Interchange object for representations in other formats\\ninterchange = forcefield.create_interchange(topology)\\n```\\n\\nDetailed examples of using SMIRNOFF with the toolkit can be found [in the documentation](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html).\\n\\n# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\\n\\nSee [`FAQ.md`](FAQ.md) for answers to a variety of common problems, such as:\\n* Why do I need to provide molecules corresponding to the components of my system, or a `Topology` with bond orders?\\n* Can I use an Amber, CHARMM, or GROMACS topology/coordinate file as a starting point for applying a SMIRNOFF force field?\\n* What if I am starting from a PDB file?\\n\\n# Contributors\\n\\nFor a partial list of contributors, see the [GitHub Contributors page](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/graphs/contributors). Others whose work constitutes significant contributions but did not make it into the `git` history include Shuzhe Wang.\\n\",\n",

This makes\\nreading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and consistent\\nsemantics.\\n\\nCompatibility\\n=============\\n\\nNew features are introduced in this third-party library and later merged\\ninto CPython. The following table indicates which versions of this library\\nwere contributed to different versions in the standard library:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - importlib_resources\\n     - stdlib\\n   * - 6.0\\n     - 3.13\\n   * - 5.12\\n     - 3.12\\n   * - 5.7\\n     - 3.11\\n   * - 5.0\\n     - 3.10\\n   * - 1.3\\n     - 3.9\\n   * - 0.5 (?)\\n     - 3.7\\n\\nFor Enterprise\\n==============\\n\\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\\n\\nThis project and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.\\n\\n`Learn more <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-importlib-resources?utm_source=pypi-importlib-resources&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github>`_.\\n\",\n",

This can be used by applications that subclassed `NotebookApp` to leverage the Python server backend of Jupyter Notebooks. Such extensions should *now* switch to `ExtensionApp` API in Jupyter Server and add `NotebookConfigShimMixin` in their inheritance list to properly handle moved traits.\\n\\nFor example, an application class that previously looked like:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom notebook.notebookapp import NotebookApp\\n\\nclass MyApplication(NotebookApp):\\n```\\n\\nshould switch to look something like:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom jupyter_server.extension.application import ExtensionApp\\nfrom notebook_shim.shim import NotebookConfigShimMixin\\n\\nclass MyApplication(NotebookConfigShimMixin, ExtensionApp):\\n```\",\n",

It provides access\\nto low level APIs for WebSockets. websocket-client implements version\\n[hybi-13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-13)\\nof the WebSocket protocol. This client does not currently support the\\npermessage-deflate extension from\\n[RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThis project's documentation can be found at\\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/)\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nPlease see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can use `pip install websocket-client` to install, or `pip install -e .`\\nto install from a local copy of the code. This module is tested on Python 3.8+.\\n\\nThere are several optional dependencies that can be installed to enable\\nspecific websocket-client features.\\n- To install `python-socks` for proxy usage and `wsaccel` for a minor performance boost, use:\\n `pip install websocket-client[optional]`\\n- To install `websockets` to run unit tests using the local echo server, use:\\n `pip install websocket-client[test]`\\n- To install `Sphinx` and `sphinx_rtd_theme` to build project documentation, use:\\n `pip install websocket-client[docs]`\\n\\nWhile not a strict dependency, [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)\\nis useful when using `run_forever` with automatic reconnect. Install rel with `pip install rel`.\\n\\nFootnote: Some shells, such as zsh, require you to escape the `[` and `]` characters with a `\\\\`.\\n\\n## Usage Tips\\n\\nCheck out the documentation's FAQ for additional guidelines:\\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)\\n\\nKnown issues with this library include lack of WebSocket Compression\\nsupport (RFC 7692) and [minimal threading documentation/support](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/threading.html).\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nThe `send` and `validate_utf8` methods can sometimes be bottleneck.\\nYou can disable UTF8 validation in this library (and receive a\\nperformance enhancement) with the `skip_utf8_validation` parameter.\\nIf you want to get better performance, install wsaccel. While\\nwebsocket-client does not depend on wsaccel, it will be used if\\navailable. wsaccel doubles the speed of UTF8 validation and\\noffers a very minor 10% performance boost when masking the\\npayload data as part of the `send` process. Numpy used to\\nbe a suggested performance enhancement alternative, but\\n[issue #687](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues/687)\\nfound it didn't help.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nMany more examples are found in the\\n[examples documentation](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).\\n\\n### Long-lived Connection\\n\\nMost real-world WebSockets situations involve longer-lived connections.\\nThe WebSocketApp `run_forever` loop will automatically try to reconnect\\nto an open WebSocket connection when a network\\nconnection is lost if it is provided with:\\n\\n- a `dispatcher` argument (async dispatcher like rel or pyevent)\\n- a non-zero `reconnect` argument (delay between disconnection and attempted reconnection)\\n\\n`run_forever` provides a variety of event-based connection controls\\nusing callbacks like `on_message` and `on_error`.\\n`run_forever` **does not automatically reconnect** if the server\\ncloses the WebSocket gracefully (returning\\n[a standard websocket close code](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html#section-7.4.1)).\\n[This is the logic](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/pull/838#issuecomment-1228454826) behind the decision.\\nCustomizing behavior when the server closes\\nthe WebSocket should be handled in the `on_close` callback.\\nThis example uses [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)\\nfor the dispatcher to provide automatic reconnection.\\n\\n```python\\nimport websocket\\nimport _thread\\nimport time\\nimport rel\\n\\ndef on_message(ws, message):\\n    print(message)\\n\\ndef on_error(ws, error):\\n    print(error)\\n\\ndef on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):\\n    print(\\\"### closed ###\\\")\\n\\ndef on_open(ws):\\n    print(\\\"Opened connection\\\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    websocket.enableTrace(True)\\n    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(\\\"wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD\\\",\\n                              on_open=on_open,\\n                              on_message=on_message,\\n                              on_error=on_error,\\n                              on_close=on_close)\\n\\n    ws.run_forever(dispatcher=rel, reconnect=5)  # Set dispatcher to automatic reconnection, 5 second reconnect delay if connection closed unexpectedly\\n    rel.signal(2, rel.abort)  # Keyboard Interrupt\\n    rel.dispatch()\\n```\\n\\n### Short-lived Connection\\n\\nThis is if you want to communicate a short message and disconnect\\nimmediately when done. For example, if you want to confirm that a WebSocket\\nserver is running and responds properly to a specific request.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom websocket import create_connection\\n\\nws = create_connection(\\\"ws://echo.websocket.events/\\\")\\nprint(ws.recv())\\nprint(\\\"Sending 'Hello, World'...\\\")\\nws.send(\\\"Hello, World\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Sent\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Receiving...\\\")\\nresult =  ws.recv()\\nprint(\\\"Received '%s'\\\" % result)\\nws.close()\\n```\\n\",\n",

With it,\\nexpressions that operate on arrays (like :code:`'3*a+4*b'`) are accelerated\\nand use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.\\n\\nIn addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your\\ncores -- which generally results in substantial performance scaling compared\\nto NumPy.\\n\\nLast but not least, numexpr can make use of Intel's VML (Vector Math\\nLibrary, normally integrated in its Math Kernel Library, or MKL).\\nThis allows further acceleration of transcendent expressions.\\n\\n\\nHow NumExpr achieves high performance\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThe main reason why NumExpr achieves better performance than NumPy is\\nthat it avoids allocating memory for intermediate results. This\\nresults in better cache utilization and reduces memory access in\\ngeneral. Due to this, NumExpr works best with large arrays.\\n\\nNumExpr parses expressions into its own op-codes that are then used by\\nan integrated computing virtual machine. The array operands are split\\ninto small chunks that easily fit in the cache of the CPU and passed\\nto the virtual machine. The virtual machine then applies the\\noperations on each chunk. It's worth noting that all temporaries and\\nconstants in the expression are also chunked. Chunks are distributed among\\nthe available cores of the CPU, resulting in highly parallelized code\\nexecution.\\n\\nThe result is that NumExpr can get the most of your machine computing\\ncapabilities for array-wise computations. Common speed-ups with regard\\nto NumPy are usually between 0.95x (for very simple expressions like\\n:code:`'a + 1'`) and 4x (for relatively complex ones like :code:`'a*b-4.1*a > 2.5*b'`),\\nalthough much higher speed-ups can be achieved for some functions  and complex\\nmath operations (up to 15x in some cases).\\n\\nNumExpr performs best on matrices that are too large to fit in L1 CPU cache.\\nIn order to get a better idea on the different speed-ups that can be achieved\\non your platform, run the provided benchmarks.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nFrom wheels\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNumExpr is available for install via `pip` for a wide range of platforms and\\nPython versions (which may be browsed at: https://pypi.org/project/numexpr/#files).\\nInstallation can be performed as::\\n\\n    pip install numexpr\\n\\nIf you are using the Anaconda or Miniconda distribution of Python you may prefer\\nto use the `conda` package manager in this case::\\n\\n    conda install numexpr\\n\\nFrom Source\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOn most \\\\*nix systems your compilers will already be present. However if you\\nare using a virtual environment with a substantially newer version of Python than\\nyour system Python you may be prompted to install a new version of `gcc` or `clang`.\\n\\nFor Windows, you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\\n(which are free) first. The version depends on which version of Python you have\\ninstalled:\\n\\nhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers\\n\\nFor Python 3.6+ simply installing the latest version of MSVC build tools should\\nbe sufficient. Note that wheels found via pip do not include MKL support. Wheels\\navailable via `conda` will have MKL, if the MKL backend is used for NumPy.\\n\\nSee `requirements.txt` for the required version of NumPy.\\n\\nNumExpr is built in the standard Python way::\\n\\n  python setup.py build install\\n\\nYou can test `numexpr` with::\\n\\n  python -c \\\"import numexpr; numexpr.test()\\\"\\n\\nDo not test NumExpr in the source directory or you will generate import errors.\\n\\nEnable Intel® MKL support\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNumExpr includes support for Intel's MKL library. This may provide better\\nperformance on Intel architectures, mainly when evaluating transcendental\\nfunctions (trigonometrical, exponential, ...).\\n\\nIf you have Intel's MKL, copy the `site.cfg.example` that comes with the\\ndistribution to `site.cfg` and edit the latter file to provide correct paths to\\nthe MKL libraries in your system.  After doing this, you can proceed with the\\nusual building instructions listed above.\\n\\nPay attention to the messages during the building process in order to know\\nwhether MKL has been detected or not.  Finally, you can check the speed-ups on\\nyour machine by running the `bench/vml_timing.py` script (you can play with\\ndifferent parameters to the `set_vml_accuracy_mode()` and `set_vml_num_threads()`\\nfunctions in the script so as to see how it would affect performance).\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\n::\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> import numexpr as ne\\n\\n  >>> a = np.arange(1e6)   # Choose large arrays for better speedups\\n  >>> b = np.arange(1e6)\\n\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"a + 1\\\")   # a simple expression\\n  array([  1.00000000e+00,   2.00000000e+00,   3.00000000e+00, ...,\\n           9.99998000e+05,   9.99999000e+05,   1.00000000e+06])\\n\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"a * b - 4.1 * a > 2.5 * b\\\")   # a more complex one\\n  array([False, False, False, ...,  True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)\\n\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"sin(a) + arcsinh(a/b)\\\")   # you can also use functions\\n  array([        NaN,  1.72284457,  1.79067101, ...,  1.09567006,\\n          0.17523598, -0.09597844])\\n\\n  >>> s = np.array([b'abba', b'abbb', b'abbcdef'])\\n  >>> ne.evaluate(\\\"b'abba' == s\\\")   # string arrays are supported too\\n  array([ True, False, False], dtype=bool)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nPlease see the official documentation at `numexpr.readthedocs.io <https://numexpr.readthedocs.io>`_.\\nIncluded is a user guide, benchmark results, and the reference API.\\n\\n\\nAuthors\\n-------\\n\\nPlease see `AUTHORS.txt <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt>`_.\\n\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\nNumExpr is distributed under the `MIT <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_ license.\\n\\n\\n..

It aims to provide selecting,\\nmatching, and filtering using modern CSS selectors. Soup Sieve currently provides selectors from the CSS level 1\\nspecifications up through the latest CSS level 4 drafts and beyond (though some are not yet implemented).\\n\\nSoup Sieve was written with the intent to replace Beautiful Soup's builtin select feature, and as of Beautiful Soup\\nversion 4.7.0, it now is :confetti_ball:. Soup Sieve can also be imported in order to use its API directly for\\nmore controlled, specialized parsing.\\n\\nSoup Sieve has implemented most of the CSS selectors up through the latest CSS draft specifications, though there are a\\nnumber that don't make sense in a non-browser environment. Selectors that cannot provide meaningful functionality simply\\ndo not match anything. Some of the supported selectors are:\\n\\n- `.classes`\\n- `#ids`\\n- `[attributes=value]`\\n- `parent child`\\n- `parent > child`\\n- `sibling ~ sibling`\\n- `sibling + sibling`\\n- `:not(element.class, element2.class)`\\n- `:is(element.class, element2.class)`\\n- `parent:has(> child)`\\n- and [many more](https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/selectors/)\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou must have Beautiful Soup already installed:\\n\\n```\\npip install beautifulsoup4\\n```\\n\\nIn most cases, assuming you've installed version 4.7.0, that should be all you need to do, but if you've installed via\\nsome alternative method, and Soup Sieve is not automatically installed, you can install it directly:\\n\\n```\\npip install soupsieve\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to manually install it from source, first ensure that [`build`](https://pypi.org/project/build/) is\\ninstalled:\\n\\n```\\npip install build\\n```\\n\\nThen navigate to the root of the project and build the wheel and install (replacing `<ver>` with the current version):\\n\\n```\\npython -m build -w\\npip install dist/soupsieve-<ver>-py3-none-any.whl\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nDocumentation is found here: https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT\\n\\n[bs4]: https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#\\n\\n[github-ci-image]: https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/workflows/build/badge.svg\\n[github-ci-link]: https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amain\\n[codecov-image]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/facelessuser/soupsieve/master.svg?logo=codecov&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[codecov-link]: https://codecov.io/github/facelessuser/soupsieve\\n[pypi-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/soupsieve.svg?logo=pypi&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[pypi-down]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/soupsieve.svg?logo=pypi&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[pypi-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soupsieve\\n[python-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/soupsieve?logo=python&logoColor=aaaaaa&labelColor=333333\\n[license-image-mit]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?labelColor=333333\\n[license-link]: https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/blob/main/LICENSE.md\\n[donate-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-3fabd1?logo=paypal\\n[donate-link]: https://www.paypal.me/facelessuser\\n\",\n",

It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality and providing an intelligent module API that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.\\n\\nArrow is named after the `arrow of time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time>`_ and is heavily inspired by `moment.js <https://github.com/moment/moment>`_ and `requests <https://github.com/psf/requests>`_.\\n\\nWhy use Arrow over built-in modules?\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nPython's standard library and some other low-level modules have near-complete date, time and timezone functionality, but don't work very well from a usability perspective:\\n\\n- Too many modules: datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz and more\\n- Too many types: date, time, datetime, tzinfo, timedelta, relativedelta, etc.\\n- Timezones and timestamp conversions are verbose and unpleasant\\n- Timezone naivety is the norm\\n- Gaps in functionality: ISO 8601 parsing, timespans, humanization\\n\\nFeatures\\n--------\\n\\n- Fully-implemented, drop-in replacement for datetime\\n- Support for Python 3.6+\\n- Timezone-aware and UTC by default\\n- Super-simple creation options for many common input scenarios\\n- ``shift`` method with support for relative offsets, including weeks\\n- Format and parse strings automatically\\n- Wide support for the `ISO 8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ standard\\n- Timezone conversion\\n- Support for ``dateutil``, ``pytz``, and ``ZoneInfo`` tzinfo objects\\n- Generates time spans, ranges, floors and ceilings for time frames ranging from microsecond to year\\n- Humanize dates and times with a growing list of contributed locales\\n- Extensible for your own Arrow-derived types\\n- Full support for PEP 484-style type hints\\n\\nQuick Start\\n-----------\\n\\nInstallation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo install Arrow, use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`_ or `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org>`_:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    $ pip install -U arrow\\n\\nExample Usage\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import arrow\\n    >>> arrow.get('2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00')\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00]>\\n\\n    >>> utc = arrow.utcnow()\\n    >>> utc\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+00:00]>\\n\\n    >>> utc = utc.shift(hours=-1)\\n    >>> utc\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T20:23:58.970460+00:00]>\\n\\n    >>> local = utc.to('US/Pacific')\\n    >>> local\\n    <Arrow [2013-05-11T13:23:58.970460-07:00]>\\n\\n    >>> local.timestamp()\\n    1368303838.970460\\n\\n    >>> local.format()\\n    '2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'\\n\\n    >>> local.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ')\\n    '2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'\\n\\n    >>> local.humanize()\\n    'an hour ago'\\n\\n    >>> local.humanize(locale='ko-kr')\\n    '한시간 전'\\n\\n.. end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nFor full documentation, please visit `arrow.readthedocs.io <https://arrow.readthedocs.io>`_.\\n\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nContributions are welcome for both code and localizations (adding and updating locales).

This file is included into docs/history.rst\\n\\n\\nGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent\\nprogramming.\\n\\nThe \\\"greenlet\\\" package is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version of\\nCPython that supports micro-threads called \\\"tasklets\\\". Tasklets run\\npseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)\\nand are synchronized with data exchanges on \\\"channels\\\".\\n\\nA \\\"greenlet\\\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of\\nmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.\\nThis is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.\\nYou can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;\\nhowever, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to\\nmake advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreate\\ngenerators; the difference with Python's own generators is that our\\ngenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions can\\nyield values too. (Additionally, you don't need a \\\"yield\\\" keyword. See\\nthe example in `test_generator.py\\n<https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/blob/adca19bf1f287b3395896a8f41f3f4fd1797fdc7/src/greenlet/tests/test_generator.py#L1>`_).\\n\\nGreenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified\\ninterpreter.\\n\\n.. _`Stackless`: http://www.stackless.com\\n\\n\\nWho is using Greenlet?\\n======================\\n\\nThere are several libraries that use Greenlet as a more flexible\\nalternative to Python's built in coroutine support:\\n\\n - `Concurrence`_\\n - `Eventlet`_\\n - `Gevent`_\\n\\n.. _Concurrence: http://opensource.hyves.org/concurrence/\\n.. _Eventlet: http://eventlet.net/\\n.. _Gevent: http://www.gevent.org/\\n\\nGetting Greenlet\\n================\\n\\nThe easiest way to get Greenlet is to install it with pip::\\n\\n  pip install greenlet\\n\\n\\nSource code archives and binary distributions are available on the\\npython package index at https://pypi.org/project/greenlet\\n\\nThe source code repository is hosted on github:\\nhttps://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet\\n\\nDocumentation is available on readthedocs.org:\\nhttps://greenlet.readthedocs.io\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"# uri-template\\n\\nAn implementation of RFC 6570 URI Templates.\\n\\nThis packages implements URI Template expansion in strict adherence to RFC 6570,\\nbut adds a few extensions.\\n\\n## RFC 6570 Extensions\\n\\n### Non-string Values\\n\\nRFC 6570 is silent regarding variable values that are not strings, lists, associative arrays, or null.\\n\\nThis package handles value types as follows:\\n\\n  * Values that are instances of `str` are treated as strings.\\n  * Values implementing `collections.abc.Sequence` are treated as lists.\\n  * Values implementing `collections.abc.Mapping` are treated as associative arrays.\\n  * `None` values are treated as null.\\n  * Boolean values are converted to the lower case strings 'true' and 'false'.\\n  * All other values will be converted to strings using the Python `str()` function.\\n\\n### Nested Structures\\n\\nThis package handles variable values with nested structure,\\nfor example, lists containing other lists or associative arrays,\\nor associative arrays containing lists or other associative arrays.\\n\\nNested values for variables that do not use the array modifier ('[]') are treated as follows:\\n\\n  * Lists containing lists are flattened into a single list.\\n  * Lists containing associative arrays are treated as a single combined associative array.\\n  * Associative arrays represent nested data using dot notation (\\\".\\\") for the variable names.\\n\\nNested values for variables that use the array modifier extend the variable name with \\nthe value's index or key written as an array subscript, e.g. \\\"foo[0]\\\" or \\\"foo[bar]\\\".\\n\\n### Default Values\\n\\nThis package allows default string values for variables per early drafts of RFC 6570.\\ne.g. \\\"{foo=bar}\\\" will expand to \\\"bar\\\" if a value for `foo` is not given.\\n\\nList and associtative array default values are not supported at this time.\\n\\n### Specifying Value Keys\\n\\nSometimes a URI Template is used to provide glue between an API and a given set of data.\\nIn this case, the names of values needed in the final URL may not match the data provided \\nfor the expansion.\\n\\nThis package allows specifying the key used to pass data into the template. \\ne.g. \\\"{?foo/bar}\\\" will expand to \\\"?foo=<the value provided as bar>\\\"\\n\\n### Partial expansion\\n\\nThis package allows partial expansion of URI Templates.\\n\\nIn a partial expansion, missing values preseve their expansion in the resultant output.\\ne.g. a partial expansion of \\\"{one}/{two}\\\" with a value for `one` of \\\"foo\\\" and `two` missing will result in:\\n\\\"foo/{two}\\\".\\n\\nIn order to allow partial expansions to preserve value joiners with expanded output,\\nexpansions accept an optional \\\"trailing joiner\\\" of \\\",\\\", \\\".\\\", \\\"/\\\", \\\";\\\", or \\\"&\\\",\\nif this joiner is present after all variables, \\nit will be appended to the output of the expansion and will suppress the output prefix.\\ne.g.: \\\"{#one,two}\\\" with a missing value for `one` and a value of \\\"bar\\\" for `two`, \\nwill partially expand to: \\\"#{#one,}bar\\\", which when provided with a value of \\\"foo\\\" for `one` \\nwill expand to \\\"#foo,bar\\\"\\n\\nSome partial expansions that have some output, but have missing values, \\nwill convert the remaining variables to a different type of expansion so that \\nfurther expansions will produce the same output as if all values were originally present.\\n\\n   * Partial Simple String Expansions will convert to Comma Expansions.\\n   * Partial Reserved Expansions Partial Fragment Expansions will convert to Reserved Comma Expansions.\\n   * Partial Form-Style Query Expansions will convert to Form-Style Query Continuations.\\n\\nIn order to preserve the resultant value of templates that are paritally expanded, \\nthe following additional Expression Expansions are supported:\\n\\n#### Comma Expansion: {,var}\\n\\nSimilar to Label Expansion with Dot-Prefix, \\nComma Expansion prefixes the expansion output with a single comma \\\",\\\".\\n\\n#### Reserved Comma Expansion: {,+var}\\n\\nSimilar to Comma Expansion, \\nReserved Comma Expansion prefixes the expansion output with a single comma \\\",\\\",\\nbut otherwise performs a Reserved Expansion ({+var}).\\n\\n## API \\n\\nThe package provides three functions:\\n\\n#### uri_template.expand(template: str, **kwargs) -> (str | None): ...\\n\\nExpand the given template, skipping missing values per RFC 6570.\\n\\nReturns `None` if the template is invalid or expansion fails.\\n\\n\\n#### uri_template.partial(template: str, **kwargs) -> (str | None): ...\\n\\nPartially expand the given template, \\nreplacing missing variables with further expansions.\\n\\nReturns `None` if the template is invalid or expansion fails.\\n\\n\\n#### uri_template.validate(template: str) -> bool: ...\\n\\nReturn `True` if the template is valid.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd the following classes:\\n\\n### uri_template.URITemplate\\n\\n#### URITemplate(template: str)\\n\\nConstruct a URITemplate for a given template string.\\n\\nRaises `ExpansionInvalid`, `ExpansionReserved`, or `VariableInvalid` if the template is invalid or unsupported.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.variables: Iterable[Variable]\\n\\nAll variables present in the template.\\nDuplicates are returned once, order is preserved.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.variable_names: Iterable[str]\\n\\nThe names of all variables present in the template.\\nDuplicates are returned once, order is preserved.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.expanded: bool\\n\\nDetermine if template is fully expanded.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.expand(**kwargs) -> str\\n\\nReturns the result of the expansion, skips missing variables.\\n\\nRaises `ExpansionFailed` if the expansion fails due to a composite value being passed to a variable with a prefix modifier.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.partial(**kwargs) -> URITemplate\\n\\nExpand the template, replacing missing variables with further expansions.\\n\\nRaises `ExpansionFailed` if the expansion fails due to a composite value being passed to a variable with a prefix modifier.\\n\\n#### URITemplate.__str__() -> str\\n\\nConvert the URITemplate object back into its original string form.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### uri_template.Variable\\n\\n#### Variable(var_spec: str)\\n\\nConstruct a Variable.\\n\\n#### Variable.name: str\\n\\nThe name of the variable\\n\\n#### Variable.max_length: int\\n\\nThe speicified max length, or `0`.\\n\\n#### Variable.explode: bool\\n\\nExplode modifier is present.\\n\\n#### Variable.array: bool\\n\\nArray modifier is present.\\n\\n#### Variable.default: (str | None)\\n\\nSpecified default value, or `None`.\\n\\n#### Variable.__str__() -> str\\n\\nConvert the variable back to its original string form.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd the following exceptions:\\n\\n#### uri_template.ExpansionInvalid\\n\\nExpansion specification is invalid. \\n\\nRaised by URITemplate constructor.\\n\\n#### uri_template.ExpansionReserved\\n\\nExpansion contains a reserved operator.\\n\\nRaised by URITemplate constructor.\\n\\n#### uri_template.VariableInvalid\\n\\nVariable specification is invalid.\\n\\nRaised by URITemplate constructor.\\n\\n#### uri_template.ExpansionFailed\\n\\nExpansion failed, currently only possible when a composite value is passed to a variable with a prefix modifier.\\n\\nRaised by URITemplate.expand() or URITemplate.partial() methods.\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nInstall with pip:\\n\\n    pip install uri-template\\n\",\n",

(Tested on Linux.) You can install this with `cargo install flamegraph`.\\n\\nRun `make build-profiling` to install a release build with debugging symbols included (needed for profiling).\\n\\nOnce that is built, you can profile pytest benchmarks with (e.g.):\\n\\n```bash\\nflamegraph -- pytest tests/benchmarks/test_micro_benchmarks.py -k test_list_of_ints_core_py --benchmark-enable\\n```\\nThe `flamegraph` command will produce an interactive SVG at `flamegraph.svg`.\\n\\n## Releasing\\n\\n1. Bump package version locally. Do not just edit `Cargo.toml` on Github, you need both `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to be updated.\\n2. Make a PR for the version bump and merge it.\\n3. Go to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/releases and click \\\"Draft a new release\\\"\\n4. In the \\\"Choose a tag\\\" dropdown enter the new tag `v<the.new.version>` and select \\\"Create new tag on publish\\\" when the option appears.\\n5. Enter the release title in the form \\\"v<the.new.version> <YYYY-MM-DD>\\\"\\n6. Click Generate release notes button\\n7. Click Publish release\\n8. Go to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/actions and ensure that all build for release are done successfully.\\n9. Go to https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-core/ and ensure that the latest release is published.\\n10. Done 🎉\\n\\n\",\n",

[TOML](https://toml.io).\\nIt is fully compatible with [TOML v1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).\\n\\nA version of Tomli, the `tomllib` module,\\nwas added to the standard library in Python 3.11\\nvia [PEP 680](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0680/).\\nTomli continues to provide a backport on PyPI for Python versions\\nwhere the standard library module is not available\\nand that have not yet reached their end-of-life.\\n\\nTomli uses [mypyc](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc)\\nto generate binary wheels for most of the widely used platforms,\\nso Python 3.11+ users may prefer it over `tomllib` for improved performance.\\nPure Python wheels are available on any platform and should perform the same as `tomllib`.\\n\\n## Installation<a name=\\\"installation\\\"></a>\\n\\n```bash\\npip install tomli\\n```\\n\\n## Usage<a name=\\\"usage\\\"></a>\\n\\n### Parse a TOML string<a name=\\\"parse-a-toml-string\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nimport tomli\\n\\ntoml_str = \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n[[players]]\\nname = \\\"Lehtinen\\\"\\nnumber = 26\\n\\n[[players]]\\nname = \\\"Numminen\\\"\\nnumber = 27\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ntoml_dict = tomli.loads(toml_str)\\nassert toml_dict == {\\n    \\\"players\\\": [{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Lehtinen\\\", \\\"number\\\": 26}, {\\\"name\\\": \\\"Numminen\\\", \\\"number\\\": 27}]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Parse a TOML file<a name=\\\"parse-a-toml-file\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nimport tomli\\n\\nwith open(\\\"path_to_file/conf.toml\\\", \\\"rb\\\") as f:\\n    toml_dict = tomli.load(f)\\n```\\n\\nThe file must be opened in binary mode (with the `\\\"rb\\\"` flag).\\nBinary mode will enforce decoding the file as UTF-8 with universal newlines disabled,\\nboth of which are required to correctly parse TOML.\\n\\n### Handle invalid TOML<a name=\\\"handle-invalid-toml\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nimport tomli\\n\\ntry:\\n    toml_dict = tomli.loads(\\\"]] this is invalid TOML [[\\\")\\nexcept tomli.TOMLDecodeError:\\n    print(\\\"Yep, definitely not valid.\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that error messages are considered informational only.\\nThey should not be assumed to stay constant across Tomli versions.\\n\\n### Construct `decimal.Decimal`s from TOML floats<a name=\\\"construct-decimaldecimals-from-toml-floats\\\"></a>\\n\\n```python\\nfrom decimal import Decimal\\nimport tomli\\n\\ntoml_dict = tomli.loads(\\\"precision-matters = 0.982492\\\", parse_float=Decimal)\\nassert isinstance(toml_dict[\\\"precision-matters\\\"], Decimal)\\nassert toml_dict[\\\"precision-matters\\\"] == Decimal(\\\"0.982492\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that `decimal.Decimal` can be replaced with another callable that converts a TOML float from string to a Python type.\\nThe `decimal.Decimal` is, however, a practical choice for use cases where float inaccuracies can not be tolerated.\\n\\nIllegal types are `dict` and `list`, and their subtypes.\\nA `ValueError` will be raised if `parse_float` produces illegal types.\\n\\n### Building a `tomli`/`tomllib` compatibility layer<a name=\\\"building-a-tomlitomllib-compatibility-layer\\\"></a>\\n\\nPython versions 3.11+ ship with a version of Tomli:\\nthe `tomllib` standard library module.\\nTo build code that uses the standard library if available,\\nbut still works seamlessly with Python 3.6+,\\ndo the following.\\n\\nInstead of a hard Tomli dependency, use the following\\n[dependency specifier](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/)\\nto only require Tomli when the standard library module is not available:\\n\\n```\\ntomli >= 1.1.0 ; python_version < \\\"3.11\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen, in your code, import a TOML parser using the following fallback mechanism:\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys\\n\\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 11):\\n    import tomllib\\nelse:\\n    import tomli as tomllib\\n\\ntomllib.loads(\\\"['This parses fine with Python 3.6+']\\\")\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ<a name=\\\"faq\\\"></a>\\n\\n### Why this parser?<a name=\\\"why-this-parser\\\"></a>\\n\\n- it's lil'\\n- pure Python with zero dependencies\\n- the fastest pure Python parser [\\\\*](#pure-python):\\n  18x as fast as [tomlkit](https://pypi.org/project/tomlkit/),\\n  2.1x as fast as [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/)\\n- outputs [basic data types](#how-do-toml-types-map-into-python-types) only\\n- 100% spec compliant: passes all tests in\\n  [BurntSushi/toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test)\\n  test suite\\n- thoroughly tested: 100% branch coverage\\n\\n### Is comment preserving round-trip parsing supported?<a name=\\\"is-comment-preserving-round-trip-parsing-supported\\\"></a>\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThe `tomli.loads` function returns a plain `dict` that is populated with builtin types and types from the standard library only.\\nPreserving comments requires a custom type to be returned so will not be supported,\\nat least not by the `tomli.loads` and `tomli.load` functions.\\n\\nLook into [TOML Kit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit) if preservation of style is what you need.\\n\\n### Is there a `dumps`, `write` or `encode` function?<a name=\\\"is-there-a-dumps-write-or-encode-function\\\"></a>\\n\\n[Tomli-W](https://github.com/hukkin/tomli-w) is the write-only counterpart of Tomli, providing `dump` and `dumps` functions.\\n\\nThe core library does not include write capability, as most TOML use cases are read-only, and Tomli intends to be minimal.\\n\\n### How do TOML types map into Python types?<a

This is the latest version of\\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\\n\\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\\n\\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\\n\\nBasic functions are simply executed:\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna\\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\\n    ドメイン.テスト\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\\n\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\\nrespectively.\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna\\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\\n    ドメイン.テスト\\n\\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\\n``idna.codec`` module:\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna.codec\\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna2008'))\\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna2008'))\\n    домен.испытание\\n\\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\\n\\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\\n\\nThis library provides one such mapping that was developed by the\\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications. Strings are\\npreprocessed according to Section 4.4 “Preprocessing for IDNA2008”\\nprior to the IDNA operations.\\n\\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\\nconversion.\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> import idna\\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\\n    ...\\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\\n    königsgäßchen\\n\\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\\n\\n.. code-block:: pycon\\n\\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\\n\\nImplementers should use transitional processing with caution, only in\\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\\nresults.\\n\\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\\nmodule name.\\n\\nExceptions\\n----------\\n\\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\\nclass.\\n\\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\\n\\nBuilding and Diagnostics\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\\n\\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\\nthree main modes:\\n\\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\\n\\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\\n\\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\\n\\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Notes\\n----------------\\n\\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\\n\\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.6 and higher.\\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\\n\\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\\n  Use \\\"idna<3\\\" in your requirements file if you need this library for\\n  a Python 2 application. Be advised that these versions are no longer\\n  actively developed.\\n\\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\\n\\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\\n\\n\",\n",

You need to make the fixing commit\\nyourself after that.\\n\\nSome of the hooks only run on CI by default, but you can invoke them by\\nrunning with the `--hook-stage manual` argument.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nAny class with trait attributes must inherit from `HasTraits`.\\nFor the list of available trait types and their properties, see the\\n[Trait Types](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trait_types.html)\\nsection of the documentation.\\n\\n### Dynamic default values\\n\\nTo calculate a default value dynamically, decorate a method of your class with\\n`@default({traitname})`. This method will be called on the instance, and\\nshould return the default value. In this example, the `_username_default`\\nmethod is decorated with `@default('username')`:\\n\\n```Python\\nimport getpass\\nfrom traitlets import HasTraits, Unicode, default\\n\\nclass Identity(HasTraits):\\n    username = Unicode()\\n\\n    @default('username')\\n    def _username_default(self):\\n        return getpass.getuser()\\n```\\n\\n### Callbacks when a trait attribute changes\\n\\nWhen a trait changes, an application can follow this trait change with\\nadditional actions.\\n\\nTo do something when a trait attribute is changed, decorate a method with\\n[`traitlets.observe()`](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html?highlight=observe#traitlets.observe).\\nThe method will be called with a single argument, a dictionary which contains\\nan owner, new value, old value, name of the changed trait, and the event type.\\n\\nIn this example, the `_num_changed` method is decorated with `` @observe(`num`) ``:\\n\\n```Python\\nfrom traitlets import HasTraits, Integer, observe\\n\\nclass TraitletsExample(HasTraits):\\n    num = Integer(5, help=\\\"a number\\\").tag(config=True)\\n\\n    @observe('num')\\n    def _num_changed(self, change):\\n        print(\\\"{name} changed from {old} to {new}\\\".format(**change))\\n```\\n\\nand is passed the following dictionary when called:\\n\\n```Python\\n{\\n  'owner': object,  # The HasTraits instance\\n  'new': 6,         # The new value\\n  'old': 5,         # The old value\\n  'name': \\\"foo\\\",    # The name of the changed trait\\n  'type': 'change', # The event type of the notification, usually 'change'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Validation and coercion\\n\\nEach trait type (`Int`, `Unicode`, `Dict` etc.) may have its own validation or\\ncoercion logic. In addition, we can register custom cross-validators\\nthat may depend on the state of other attributes. For example:\\n\\n```Python\\nfrom traitlets import HasTraits, TraitError, Int, Bool, validate\\n\\nclass Parity(HasTraits):\\n    value = Int()\\n    parity = Int()\\n\\n    @validate('value')\\n    def _valid_value(self, proposal):\\n        if proposal['value'] % 2 != self.parity:\\n            raise TraitError('value and parity should be consistent')\\n        return proposal['value']\\n\\n    @validate('parity')\\n    def _valid_parity(self, proposal):\\n        parity = proposal['value']\\n        if parity not in [0, 1]:\\n            raise TraitError('parity should be 0 or 1')\\n        if self.value % 2 != parity:\\n            raise TraitError('value and parity should be consistent')\\n        return proposal['value']\\n\\nparity_check = Parity(value=2)\\n\\n# Changing required parity and value together while holding cross validation\\nwith parity_check.hold_trait_notifications():\\n    parity_check.value = 1\\n    parity_check.parity = 1\\n```\\n\\nHowever, we **recommend** that custom cross-validators don't modify the state\\nof the HasTraits instance.\\n\\n## About the IPython Development Team\\n\\nThe IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython project.\\nThis includes all of the IPython subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nIPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright\\nover their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these\\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories.

Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor and patch versions. Different minor versions likely include API-changes while patch versions do not change API.\\n\\nWhen a new minor version is released on PyPI, a branch for that version will be created in this repository, and the version of the main branch will be bumped to the next minor version number. That way, the main branch always reflects the latest un-released version.\\n\\nTo see the changes between releases, checkout the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\n## Usage - Running Jupyter Server\\n\\n### Running in a local installation\\n\\nLaunch with:\\n\\n```\\njupyter server\\n```\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#running-tests).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst).\\n\\n## Team Meetings and Roadmap\\n\\n- When: Thursdays [8:00am, Pacific time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=8%3A00%20am&tz=San%20Francisco&)\\n- Where: [Jovyan Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/95228013874?pwd=Ep7HIk8t9JP6VToxt1Wj4P7K5PshC0.1)\\n- What:\\n  - [Meeting notes](https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20Meeting%20Notes%20)\\n  - [Agenda](https://hackmd.io/Wmz_wjrLRHuUbgWphjwRWw)\\n\\nSee our tentative [roadmap here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/127).\\n\\n## About the Jupyter Development Team\\n\\nThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.\\nThis includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright\\nover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these\\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter\\nsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\\ninstitution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter\\nDevelopment Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\\nchange to one of the Jupyter repositories.\\n\\nWith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\\n\\n```\\n# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.\\n# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.\\n```\\n\",\n",

This presents a practical problem:\\nWhen in an environment where the event loop is\\nalready running it's impossible to run tasks and wait\\nfor the result. Trying to do so will give the error\\n\\\"``RuntimeError: This event loop is already running``\\\".\\n\\nThe issue pops up in various environments, such as web servers,\\nGUI applications and in Jupyter notebooks.\\n\\nThis module patches asyncio to allow nested use of ``asyncio.run`` and\\n``loop.run_until_complete``.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n    pip3 install nest_asyncio\\n\\nPython 3.5 or higher is required.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    import nest_asyncio\\n    nest_asyncio.apply()\\n\\nOptionally the specific loop that needs patching can be given\\nas argument to ``apply``, otherwise the current event loop is used.\\nAn event loop can be patched whether it is already running\\nor not. Only event loops from asyncio can be patched;\\nLoops from other projects, such as uvloop or quamash,\\ngenerally can't be patched.\\n\\n\\n.. |Build| image:: https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branche=master\\n   :alt: Build\\n   :target: https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio/actions\\n\\n.. |PyPiVersion| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/nest_asyncio.svg\\n   :alt: PyPi\\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nest_asyncio\\n\\n.. |Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-green.svg\\n   :alt:\\n\\n.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-blue.svg\\n   :alt:\\n\\n.. |Downloads| image:: https://static.pepy.tech/badge/nest-asyncio/month\\n   :alt: Number of downloads\\n   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/nest-asyncio\\n\\n\",\n",

This is now supported in OpenMM 7.5.0 and later.\\n\\n**Espaloma:** Currently [`espaloma-0.3.2`](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma/releases/tag/0.3.2) is supported. See our [first espaloma paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01196) and our second paper which focuses on [protein-ligand systems and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07085).\\n\\n# Using the force fields\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package provides additional AMBER and CHARMM biopolymer force fields, small molecule support through GAFF and the [Open Force Field toolkit](http://openforcefield.org), and force field conversion tools.\\n\\nThe easiest way to install this package and its requisite dependencies is via [`conda`](https://conda.io):\\n```bash\\nconda install --yes -c conda-forge openmmforcefields\\n```\\n\\nIf you optionally have the [OpenEye Toolkits](https://www.eyesopen.com/toolkit-development) installed, `openmmforcefields` will use these to accelerate small molecule parameterization.\\nFree academic licenses are available for [bona fide academic research](https://www.eyesopen.com/academic-licensing), while licenses for IP generation are available [for a fee](https://www.eyesopen.com/pricing).\\n\\nSupport for the SMIRNOFF residue template or system generators requires OpenMM 7.4.2 or later.\\n\\n## Using the AMBER and CHARMM biopolymer force fields\\n\\nThis repository contains force fields for use with the [OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#force-fields) for parameterizing biomolecular systems.\\nIf you're not familiar with this approach to applying parameters to biomolecular systems, please see the [OpenMM User Guide](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#force-fields).\\n\\n### Using the AMBER force fields\\n\\nOnce installed, the AMBER force fields will be registered in the `amber/` relative path searched by [`openmm.app.ForceField`](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField).\\n\\nFor example, to specify the newer recommended [`ff14SB`](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255) force field and accompanying recommended ions and solvent models (corresponding to force fields loaded in LEaP with `leaprc.protein.ff14SB`), prepend the `amber` prefix and the `.xml` suffix:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\")\\n```\\nTo access just the [`ff14SB`](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255) force field converted from `oldff/leaprc.ff14SB`:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"amber/ff14SB.xml\\\")\\n```\\nor to specifically access the older (now outdated) `ff99SBildn` force field converted from `oldff/leaprc.ff14SB`:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"amber/ff99SBildn.xml\\\")\\n```\\nThe TIP3P conversion also includes the [Joung and Cheatham recommended salt models](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp8001614) (`parm/frcmod.ionsjc_tip3p`) and recommended divalent counterion parameters (`parm/frcmod.ions234lm_126_tip3p`):\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\n    \\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml\\\",\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Using the CHARMM force fields\\n\\nSimilarly, the CHARMM force fields will be registered in the `charmm/` relative path.\\nFor example, model system small molecule templates corresponding to amino acids can be accessed with:\\n```python\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\\"charmm/toppar_all36_prot_model.xml\\\")\\n```\\n\\n## Using AMBER GAFF 1.x and 2.x for small molecules\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package includes a [residue template generator](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#adding-residue-template-generators) for [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) that automatically generates OpenMM residue templates for small molecules lacking parameters using [GAFF](http://ambermd.org/antechamber/gaff.html) versions 1 or 2.\\n\\n### Cheminformatics toolkits\\n\\nThe [`openff-toolkit`](http://openforcefield.org) is used to provide an interface with cheminformatics toolkits to interact with [`antechamber`](http://ambermd.org/antechamber/) from the [AmberTools](http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) package to generate parameters for small molecules.\\nBy default, the [`openff-toolkit`](http://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit) will make use of the free and open source [RDKit cheminformatics toolkit](https://www.rdkit.org/) that is installed automatically, but will optionally use the [OpenEye toolkit](https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/index.html) if it is installed and licensed.\\nThe OpenEye toolkit is available [for free for academics for non-IP-generating academic research](https://www.eyesopen.com/academic-licensing).\\n\\n### On-the-fly template generation for small molecules\\n\\nGeneration of OpenMM-compatible parameters for small molecules encountered in an OpenMM `Topology` is handled through `openmmforcefields.generators.GAFFTemplateGenerator`.\\nBecause the [OpenMM `Topology` object](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.topology.Topology.html#openmm.app.topology.Topology) used by [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) does not know the precise chemical identity of molecules represented in the topology---which contain only elements and bonds between them, without stereochemical or bond order information---it is necessary to instruct `GAFFTemplateGenerator` which small molecules it will encounter in processing the `Topology` object ahead of time; it then matches these by element and bond pattern.\\n\\n### Specifying molecules\\n\\nTo do this, it is necessary to specify one or more [`openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule`](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) objects which can easily be created from many different representations of small molecules, including SMILES strings and common molecule storage formats.\\nThere are many ways to create an [OpenFF `Molecule` object](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) from various file formats as well---see the [API docs](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) for more details.\\n\\n### Partial charges for small molecules\\n\\nIf the provided molecule(s) contain nonzero (user-specified) partial charges (stored in the `Molecule.partial_charges` attribute), those partial charges will be used.\\nIf they do _not_ contain partial charges, the OpenFF Toolkit is used to generate them.\\n\\n* In `GAFFTemplateGenerator`, [Antechamber](http://ambermd.org/antechamber/) from the [AmberTools](http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) distribution (which uses the `sqm` semiempirical quantum chemical package) is used to assign AM1-BCC charges (`antechamber -c bcc`). The conformers used in charge assignment are generated by RDKit.\\n* In `SMIRNOFFTemplateGenerator`, the charges are assigned by the OpenFF software according to the [AM1-BCC settings of the SMIRNOFF specification](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/#toolkitam1bcc-temporary-support-for-toolkit-based-am1-bcc-partial-charges).\\n  * If OpenEye Toolkits are installed and licensed, OpenEye's Quacpac Toolkit is used to generate [AM1-BCC-ELF10 charges](https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/quacpactk/OEProtonClasses/OEAM1BCCELF10Charges.html). In this case, the conformers used to generate charges are generated by OpenEye's Omega Toolkit.\\n  * If OpenEye Toolkits are not installed or not licensed, AmberTools's Antechamber/`sqm` is used to generate AM1-BCC charges in the same way that it is used in `GAFFTemplateGenerator`. In this case, the conformers used to generate charges are generated by RDKit.\\n\\n*Note:* The `Molecule` object must have the all protons and stereochemistry explicitly specified, and must match the exact protonation and tautomeric state of the molecule that will be found in your OpenMM `Topology` object.\\nThe atom ordering need not be the same.\\n\\n*Note:* The first time a `Molecule` is specified, added, or cached, if it lacks partial charges, the automatically generated charges will be cached and reused; if it contains user-specified partial charges, those charges will be used and cached. Adding the molecule again with a different set of charges will have no effect on changing which charges are assigned.\\n\\n### Caching\\n\\n`GAFFTemplateGenerator` also supports the ability to specify a cache filename, allowing parameters for small molecules to be computed only once and then cached in the specified cache file thereafter.\\n\\n### Examples using `GAFFTemplateGenerator` to generate small molecule GAFF parameters\\n\\nCreate a GAFF template generator for a single molecule (benzene, created from SMILES) and register it with ForceField:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create an OpenFF Molecule object for benzene from SMILES\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\n\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_smiles(\\\"c1ccccc1\\\")\\n# Create the GAFF template generator\\nfrom openmmforcefields.generators import (\\n    GAFFTemplateGenerator,\\n)\\n\\ngaff = GAFFTemplateGenerator(molecules=molecule)\\n# Create an OpenMM ForceField object with AMBER ff14SB and TIP3P with compatible ions\\nfrom openmm.app import ForceField\\n\\nforcefield = ForceField(\\n    \\\"amber/protein.ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    \\\"amber/tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml\\\",\\n)\\n# Register the GAFF template generator\\nforcefield.registerTemplateGenerator(gaff.generator)\\n# You can now parameterize an OpenMM Topology object that contains the specified molecule.\\n# forcefield will load the appropriate GAFF parameters when needed, and antechamber\\n# will be used to generate small molecule parameters on the fly.\\nfrom openmm.app import PDBFile\\n\\npdbfile = PDBFile(\\\"t4-lysozyme-L99A-with-benzene.pdb\\\")\\nsystem = forcefield.createSystem(pdbfile.topology)\\n```\\n\\nThe latest available GAFF version is used if none is specified.\\nYou can check which GAFF version is in use with\\n\\n```pycon\\n>>> gaff.gaff_version\\n'2.11'\\n````\\n\\nCreate a template generator for a specific GAFF version for multiple molecules read from an SDF file:\\n\\n```python\\nmolecules = Molecule.from_file(\\\"molecules.sdf\\\")\\ngaff = GAFFTemplateGenerator(molecules=molecules, forcefield=\\\"gaff-2.11\\\")\\n```\\nYou can also add molecules to the generator later, even after the generator has been registered:\\n```python\\ngaff.add_molecules(molecule)\\ngaff.add_molecules([molecule1, molecule2])\\n```\\nTo check which GAFF versions are supported, examine the `INSTALLED_FORCEFIELDS` attribute:\\n```pycon\\n>>> print(GAFFTemplateGenerator.INSTALLED_FORCEFIELDS)\\n['gaff-1.4', 'gaff-1.8', 'gaff-1.81', 'gaff-2.1', 'gaff-2.11']\\n```\\nYou can optionally specify a file that contains a cache of pre-parameterized molecules:\\n```python\\ngenerator = GAFFTemplateGenerator(cache=\\\"gaff-molecules.json\\\", forcefield=\\\"gaff-1.8\\\")\\n```\\nNewly parameterized molecules will be written to the cache, saving time next time these molecules are encountered.\\n\\n## Using the Open Force Field Initiative SMIRNOFF small molecule force fields\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package includes a [residue template generator](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#adding-residue-template-generators) for [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) that automatically generates OpenMM residue templates for small molecules lacking parameters using the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) [SMIRNOFF](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/)small molecule force fields.\\nThis includes the [`openff-1.x.y` (\\\"Parsley\\\")](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/) and [`openff-2.x.y` (\\\"Sage\\\")](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00039) small molecule force field lines, including the [most recent force field in each lines](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields).\\n\\nThe `SMIRNOFFTemplateGenerator` residue template generator operates in a manner very similar to `GAFFTemplateGenerator`, so we only highlight its differences here.\\n\\n### Examples using `SMIRNOFFTemplateGenerator` to generate small molecule SMIRNOFF parameters\\n\\nCreate a SMIRNOFF template generator for a single molecule (benzene, created from SMILES) and register it with ForceField:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create an OpenFF Molecule object for benzene from SMILES\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\n\\nmolecule =

switchDistance=0.8 * openmm.unit.nanometer,\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThe latest official Open Force Field Initiative release ([`openff-1.2.0`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields) of the [\\\"Parsley\\\" small molecule force field](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/)) is used if none is specified.\\nYou can check which SMIRNOFF force field is in use

generator](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#adding-residue-template-generators) for [the OpenMM `ForceField` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField.html#openmm.app.forcefield.ForceField) that can automatically generate OpenMM residue templates for small molecules lacking parameters using [espaloma](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma) via one of its released force fields, provided `espaloma` and its dependencies are installed.\\n`espaloma` uses a [graph convolutional model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01196) to generate both valence parameters and fast partial charges.\\n\\n\\nThe `EspalomaTemplateGenerator` residue template generator operates in a manner very similar to `GAFFTemplateGenerator`, so we only highlight its differences here.\\n\\n**This feature is currently experimental and its API is subject to change.**\\n\\n### Examples using `EspalomaTemplateGenerator` to generate small molecule parameters with espaloma\\n\\nCreate an espaloma template generator for a single molecule (benzene, created from SMILES) and register it with ForceField:\\n```python\\n# Create an OpenFF Molecule object for benzene from SMILES\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\n\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_smiles(\\\"c1ccccc1\\\")\\n# Create the

written to the cache, saving time next time these molecules are encountered.\\n\\n## Automating force field management with `SystemGenerator`\\n\\nThe `openmmforcefields` package provides the `openmmforcefields.generators.SystemGenerator` class that handles management of common force fields transparently for you.\\n\\n### Using `SystemGenerator` to automate the use of AMBER force fields with GAFF, OpenFF, or espaloma for small molecule parameterization\\n\\nHere's an example that uses GAFF 2.11 along with the new `ff14SB` generation of AMBER force fields (and compatible solvent models) to generate an OpenMM `System` object from an [Open Force Field `Topology`](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Topology.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Topology) object:\\n```python\\n# Define the keyword

`db.json`.\\nParameters for multiple force fields can be held in the same cache file.\\n\\nBy default, `SystemGenerator` will use `PME` for periodic systems and `NoCutoff` for non-periodic systems.\\nYou can modify this behavior with the optional `periodic_forcefield_kwargs` and `nonperiodic_forcefield_kwargs` arguments, which are used to update `forcefield_kwargs` depending on whether the system is periodic or non-periodic:\\n```python\\nfrom openmm import app\\n\\nsystem_generator = SystemGenerator(\\n    forcefields=[\\n        \\\"amber/ff14SB.xml\\\",\\n        \\\"amber/tip3p_standard.xml\\\",\\n    ],\\n    periodic_forcefield_kwargs={\\\"nonbondedMethod\\\": app.LJPME},\\n    nonperiodic_forcefield_kwargs={\\\"nonbondedMethod\\\": app.CutoffNonPeriodic},\\n)\\n```\\n\\nTo use the [Open Force Field `openff-1.2.0`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields), an update of the [Open Force Field (\\\"Parsley\\\") small molecule force field](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/) instead of GAFF 2.11, we would have instead specified `small_molecule_forcefield='openff-1.2.0'`.\\n\\nTo use [espaloma](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma) for assigning small molecule parameters, for example with the [`espaloma-0.3.2` model](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma/releases/tag/0.3.2) released with the [espaloma preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07085), you can specify `small_molecule_forcefield='espaloma-0.3.2'`.\\n\\n# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n\\n**Q:** What is the minimum version of OpenMM required to use this package?\\n<br>\\n**A:** You need at least OpenMM 7.4.2 to use the `openmmforcefields` package.\\n\\n**Q:** Do you support the new [Amber ff19SB protein force field](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/ff19SB_Amino-Acid_Specific_Protein_Backbone_Parameters_Trained_Against_Quantum_Mechanics_Energy_Surfaces_in_Solution/8279681/1)?\\n<br>\\n**A:** [ParmEd](http://github.com/parmed/parmed), which is used to convert these force fields to OpenMM format, [does not currently support the conversion of AMBER CMAP forces to OpenMM](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd/issues/1066), so we do not yet support this force field, but hope to add support soon.\\n\\n**Q:** Do you plan to support other small molecule force fields?\\n<br>\\n**A:** If there are other free and open source conda-installable tools for generating parameters for other AMBER- or CHARMM-compatible force fields, we are happy to add support for them!\\n\\n# Converting AMBER and CHARMM to OpenMM ffxml files\\n\\nSee the corresponding directories for information on how to use the provided conversion tools:\\n\\n* `amber/` - AMBER force fields and conversion tools\\n* `charmm/` - CHARMM force fields and conversion tools\\n\\n# [Changelog](https://github.com/openmm/openmmforcefields/releases)\\n\\n## 0.14.1 Bring back GAFFTemplateGenerator for OpenMM >=7.6.0\\n\\nThis release brings back GAFF force feild support for all versions of OpenMM previously supported.\\nAdditionally, we now use the output of parmchk2 for all GAFF parameters.\\nPreviously we used gaff.dat + parmchk2 output to generate forcefield parameters.\\nFunctionally this doesn't change the end user experience but means we do not need to create new forcefield XML files for newer GAFF versions and now support whatever GAFF versions that parmchk2 supports for the installed AmberTools version.\\nThe XML files in `openmmforcefields/ffxml/amber/gaff/ffxml` may be removed in a future release.\\n\\n## 0.14.0 Bring back GAFFTemplateGenerator\\n\\nThis release effectively reverts the changes in 0.13.0. This release is **only** compatible with OpenMM 8.1.2. No other changes were made.\\n\\n## 0.13.0 Temporarily remove GAFFTemplateGenerator\\n\\nThis release temporarily removes GAFFTemplateGenerator because of packaging incompatibilities with\\nAmberTools 23.

An action is a function of the form\\n   ``action(key, value, format, meta)``, where:\\n\\n   -  ``key`` is the type of the pandoc object (e.g. 'Str', 'Para')\\n   -  ``value`` is the contents of the object (e.g. a string for 'Str', a list of\\n      inline elements for 'Para')\\n   -  ``format`` is the target output format (as supplied by the\\n      ``format`` argument of ``walk``)\\n   -  ``meta`` is the document's metadata\\n\\n   The return of an action is either:\\n\\n   -  ``None``: this means that the object should remain unchanged\\n   -  a pandoc object: this will replace the original object\\n   -  a list of pandoc objects: these will replace the original object;\\n      the list is merged with the neighbors of the original objects\\n      (spliced into the list the original object belongs to); returning\\n      an empty list deletes the object\\n\\n-  ``toJSONFilter(action)``\\n\\n   Like ``toJSONFilters``, but takes a single action as argument.\\n\\n-  ``toJSONFilters(actions)``\\n\\n   Generate a JSON-to-JSON filter from stdin to stdout\\n\\n   The filter:\\n\\n   -  reads a JSON-formatted pandoc document from stdin\\n   -  transforms it by walking the tree and performing the actions\\n   -  returns a new JSON-formatted pandoc document to stdout\\n\\n   The argument ``actions`` is a list of functions of the form\\n   ``action(key, value, format, meta)``, as described in more detail\\n   under ``walk``.\\n\\n   This function calls ``applyJSONFilters``, with the ``format``\\n   argument provided by the first command-line argument, if present.\\n   (Pandoc sets this by default when calling filters.)\\n\\n-  ``applyJSONFilters(actions, source, format=\\\"\\\")``\\n\\n   Walk through JSON structure and apply filters\\n\\n   This:\\n\\n   -  reads a JSON-formatted pandoc document from a source string\\n   -  transforms it by walking the tree and performing the actions\\n   -  returns a new JSON-formatted pandoc document as a string\\n\\n   The ``actions`` argument is a list of functions (see ``walk`` for a\\n   full description).\\n\\n   The argument ``source`` is a string encoded JSON object.\\n\\n   The argument ``format`` is a string describing the output format.\\n\\n   Returns a new JSON-formatted pandoc document.\\n\\n-  ``stringify(x)``\\n\\n   Walks the tree x and returns concatenated string content, leaving out\\n   all formatting.\\n\\n-  ``attributes(attrs)``\\n\\n   Returns an attribute list, constructed from the dictionary attrs.\\n\\nHow to use\\n----------\\nMost users will only need ``toJSONFilter``.  Here is a simple example\\nof its use::\\n\\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Pandoc filter to convert all regular text to uppercase.\\n    Code, link URLs, etc. are not affected.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    from pandocfilters import toJSONFilter, Str\\n\\n    def caps(key, value, format, meta):\\n      if key == 'Str':\\n        return Str(value.upper())\\n\\n    if __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n      toJSONFilter(caps)\\n\\nExamples\\n--------\\n\\nThe examples subdirectory in the source repository contains the\\nfollowing filters. These filters should provide a useful starting point\\nfor developing your own pandocfilters.\\n\\n``abc.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``abc`` containing ABC\\n    notation into images. Assumes that abcm2ps and ImageMagick's convert\\n    are in the path. Images are put in the abc-images directory.\\n\\n``caps.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert all regular text to uppercase. Code, link\\n    URLs, etc. are not affected.\\n\\n``blockdiag.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class \\\"blockdiag\\\" into\\n    generated images. Needs utils from http://blockdiag.com.\\n\\n``comments.py``\\n    Pandoc filter that causes everything between\\n    ``<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->`` and ``<!-- END COMMENT -->`` to be ignored.\\n    The comment lines must appear on lines by themselves, with blank\\n    lines surrounding\\n\\n``deemph.py``\\n    Pandoc filter that causes emphasized text to be displayed in ALL\\n    CAPS.\\n\\n``deflists.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert definition lists to bullet lists with the\\n    defined terms in strong emphasis (for compatibility with standard\\n    markdown).\\n\\n``gabc.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert code blocks with class \\\"gabc\\\" to LaTeX\\n    \\\\\\\\gabcsnippet commands in LaTeX output, and to images in HTML output.\\n\\n``graphviz.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``graphviz`` into\\n    graphviz-generated images.\\n\\n``lilypond.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class \\\"ly\\\" containing\\n    Lilypond notation.\\n\\n``metavars.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to allow interpolation of metadata fields into a\\n    document. ``%{fields}`` will be replaced by the field's value, assuming\\n    it is of the type ``MetaInlines`` or ``MetaString``.\\n\\n``myemph.py``\\n    Pandoc filter that causes emphasis to be rendered using the custom\\n    macro ``\\\\myemph{...}`` rather than ``\\\\emph{...}`` in latex. Other output\\n    formats are unaffected.\\n\\n``plantuml.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``plantuml`` to images.\\n    Needs `plantuml.jar` from http://plantuml.com/.\\n\\n``ditaa.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process code blocks with class ``ditaa`` to images.\\n    Needs `ditaa.jar` from http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/.\\n\\n``theorem.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to convert divs with ``class=\\\"theorem\\\"`` to LaTeX theorem\\n    environments in LaTeX output, and to numbered theorems in HTML\\n    output.\\n\\n``tikz.py``\\n    Pandoc filter to process raw latex tikz environments into images.\\n    Assumes that pdflatex is in the path, and that the standalone\\n    package is available. Also assumes that ImageMagick's convert is in\\n    the path. Images are put in the ``tikz-images`` directory.\\n\\nAPI documentation\\n-----------------\\n\\nBy default most filters use ``get_filename4code`` to\\ncreate a directory ``...-images`` to save temporary\\nfiles. This directory doesn't get removed as it can be used as a cache so that\\nlater pandoc runs don't have to recreate files if they already exist. The\\ndirectory is generated in the current directory.\\n\\nIf you prefer to have a clean directory after running pandoc filters, you\\ncan set an environment variable ``PANDOCFILTER_CLEANUP`` to any non-empty value such as `1`\\nwhich forces the code to create a temporary directory that will be removed\\nby the end of execution.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

What we are trying to\\nachieve here is to address the shortcomings of `isodate` (as described in their own\\n[_Limitations_](https://github.com/gweis/isodate/#limitations) section), and a few of\\nour own annoyances with their interface, such as the lack of uniformity in their\\nhandling of types, and the use of regular expressions for parsing.\\n\\n## How to use it.\\n\\nThis package revolves around the [`Duration`](src/isoduration/types.py) type.\\n\\nGiven a ISO duration string we can produce such a type by using the `parse_duration()`\\nfunction:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> from isoduration import parse_duration\\n>>> duration = parse_duration(\\\"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\\\")\\n>>> duration.date\\nDateDuration(years=Decimal('3'), months=Decimal('6'), days=Decimal('4'), weeks=Decimal('0'))\\n>>> duration.time\\nTimeDuration(hours=Decimal('12'), minutes=Decimal('30'), seconds=Decimal('5'))\\n```\\n\\nThe `date` and `time` portions of the parsed duration are just regular\\n[dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), so their members can\\nbe accessed in a non-surprising way.\\n\\nBesides just parsing them, a number of additional operations are available:\\n\\n- Durations can be compared and negated:\\n  ```py\\n  >>> parse_duration(\\\"P3Y4D\\\") == parse_duration(\\\"P3Y4DT0H\\\")\\n  True\\n  >>> -parse_duration(\\\"P3Y4D\\\")\\n  Duration(DateDuration(years=Decimal('-3'), months=Decimal('0'), days=Decimal('-4'), weeks=Decimal('0')), TimeDuration(hours=Decimal('0'), minutes=Decimal('0'), seconds=Decimal('0')))\\n  ```\\n- Durations can be added to, or subtracted from, Python datetimes:\\n  ```py\\n  >>> from datetime import datetime\\n  >>> datetime(2020, 3, 15) + parse_duration(\\\"P2Y\\\")\\n  datetime.datetime(2022, 3, 15, 0, 0)\\n  >>> datetime(2020, 3, 15) - parse_duration(\\\"P33Y1M4D\\\")\\n  datetime.datetime(1987, 2, 11, 0, 0)\\n  ```\\n- Durations are hashable, so they can be used as dictionary keys or as part of sets.\\n- Durations can be formatted back to a ISO 8601-compliant duration string:\\n  ```py\\n  >>> from isoduration import parse_duration, format_duration\\n  >>> format_duration(parse_duration(\\\"P11YT2H\\\"))\\n  'P11YT2H'\\n  >>> str(parse_duration(\\\"P11YT2H\\\"))\\n  'P11YT2H'\\n  ```\\n\\n## How to improve it.\\n\\nThese steps, in this order, should land you in a development environment:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone git@github.com:bolsote/isoduration.git\\ncd isoduration/\\npython -m venv ve\\n. ve/bin/activate\\npip install -U pip\\npip install -e .\\npip install -r requirements/dev.txt\\n```\\n\\nAdapt to your own likings and/or needs.\\n\\nTesting is driven by [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io). The output of `tox -l` and a\\ncareful read of [tox.ini](tox.ini) should get you there.\\n\\n## FAQs.\\n\\n### How come `P1Y != P365D`?\\nSome years have 366 days. If it's not always the same, then it's not the same.\\n\\n### Why do you create your own types, instead of somewhat shoehorning a `timedelta`?\\n`timedelta` cannot represent certain durations, such as those involving years or months.\\nSince it cannot represent all possible durations without dangerous arithmetic, then it\\nmust not be the right type.\\n\\n### Why don't you use regular expressions to parse duration strings?\\n[Regular expressions should only be used to parse regular languages.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454)\\n\\n### Why is parsing the inverse of formatting, but the converse is not true?\\nBecause this wonderful representation is not unique.\\n\\n### Why do you support `<insert here a weird case>`?\\nProbably because the standard made me to.\\n\\n### Why do you not support `<insert here a weird case>`?\\nProbably because the standard doesn't allow me to.\\n\\n### Why is it not possible to subtract a datetime from a duration?\\nI'm confused.\\n\\n### Why should I use this over some other thing?\\nYou shouldn't do what people on the Internet tell you to do.\\n\\n### Why are ISO standards so strange?\\nYes.\\n\\n## References.\\n\\n- [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes, Appendix D](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats):\\n  This excitingly named document contains more details about ISO 8601 than any human\\n  should be allowed to understand.\\n- [`isodate`](https://pypi.org/project/isodate/): The original implementation of ISO\\n  durations in Python.

This library allows\\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\\n\\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\\nstandard Python distutils.\\n\\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\\n\\n    pip install pytz\\n\\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\\nadministrative user::\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\n\\npytz for Enterprise\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\\n\\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.\\n\\n\\nExample & Usage\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nLocalized times and date arithmetic\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n>>> from pytz import timezone\\n>>> import pytz\\n>>> utc = pytz.utc\\n>>> utc.zone\\n'UTC'\\n>>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')\\n>>> eastern.zone\\n'US/Eastern'\\n>>> amsterdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')\\n>>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z'\\n\\nThis library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The\\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\\ninformation):\\n\\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\\n\\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\\n\\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\\n\\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\\n\\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\\\ Does not work this way!\\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\\n\\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\\nas UTC:\\n\\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\\\ Not recommended except for UTC\\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\\n\\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\\nby humans.\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\\ntimezone.\\n\\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\\nsection for more details)\\n\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\\nstandard astimezone method.\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\\nTrue\\n\\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\\ndeal with.\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\\n\\n\\n``tzinfo`` API\\n--------------\\n\\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\\n\\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\\n\\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\\n\\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps.

For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\\nhappens:\\n\\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\\n\\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\\n\\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\\n\\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\\n\\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\\n\\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\\n\\n>>> import pickle, pytz\\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\\n17\\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\\n>>> new == dt\\nTrue\\n>>> new is dt\\nFalse\\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\\nTrue\\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\\nTrue\\n\\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\\nnot compare the same in Python.\\n\\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\\nFalse\\n\\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\\n\\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\\n\\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\\n\\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\\ntimes.\\n\\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\\nTime:\\n\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\\n>>> try:\\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\\n\\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\\nthe entire hour:\\n\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\\n>>> try:\\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\\n\\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\\neasier:\\n\\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\\nTrue\\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\\n\\n\\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\\n'0:24:01'\\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\\n'0:00:01'\\n\\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\\n\\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\\n\\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\\nincluded for tests only!):\\n\\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\\n>>> str(dt)\\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\\n\\nNotice the first two results?

Example notebooks are rendered online among examples from other projects in the [OpenFF ecosysytem docs](https://docs.openforcefield.org/en/latest/examples.html)\\n\\n## How to cite\\n\\nPlease cite Interchange using the [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10068101) of the [latest release](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8147764) or the version that was used. The BibTeX reference of the latest release can be found [at this link](https://zenodo.org/record/8147764/export/hx).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nRecent versions of the OpenFF Toolkit (0.11.0+, released August 2022) install Interchange by default through its `conda` package.\\n\\nInterchange can also be installed manually via `conda` (or `mamba`):\\n\\n```shell\\nconda install openff-interchange -c conda-forge\\n```\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nThe `Iterchange` object serves primarily as a container object for parametrized data. It can currently take in [SMIRNOFF](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/) or [Foyer](https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/) force fields\\nand [chemical topologies](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/topology.html) prepared via the [OpenFF Toolkit](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/). The resulting object stores parametrized data and provides APIs for export to common formats.\\n\\n```python3\\nfrom openff.toolkit import ForceField, Molecule\\nfrom openff.units import unit\\n\\nfrom openff.interchange import Interchange\\n\\n\\n# Use the OpenFF Toolkit to generate a molecule object from a SMILES pattern\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_smiles(\\\"CCO\\\")\\n\\n# Generate a conformer to be used as atomic coordinates\\nmolecule.generate_conformers(n_conformers=1)\\n\\n# Convert this molecule to a topology\\ntopology = molecule.to_topology()\\n\\n# Define periodicity via box vectors\\ntopology.box_vectors = unit.Quantity([4, 4, 4], unit.nanometer)\\n\\n# Load OpenFF 2.0.0 \\\"Sage\\\"\\nsage = ForceField(\\\"openff-2.0.0.offxml\\\")\\n\\n# Create an Interchange object\\nout = Interchange.from_smirnoff(force_field=sage, topology=topology)\\n\\n# Convert the Interchnage object to an OpenMM System\\nsystem = out.to_openmm()\\n\\n# or write to GROMACS files\\nout.to_gro(\\\"out.gro\\\")\\nout.to_top(\\\"out.top\\\")\\n\\n# or store as JSON\\njson_blob = out.json()\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, please consult the [full documentation](https://openff-interchange.readthedocs.io/).\\n\\nFor more examples specific to Interchange, navigate to the `examples/` directory.\\n\\n**Please note that this software in an early and experimental state without a stable API or guarantees of long-term stability.**\\n\\n## Copyright\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2020, Open Force Field Initiative\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThe source code of Interchange is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-interchange) and is available under the MIT license (see the file LICENSE).

See the\\n  instructions in the `Building the docs`_ section for details.\\n\\nWorkflow to contribute\\n======================\\n\\nTo contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github\\n<https://github.com/>`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository\\n<https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_ to have your own repository,\\nclone it using ``git clone``. Make your changes in a branch of your clone, push\\nthem to your github account, test them locally, and when you are happy with\\nthem, send a pull request to the main repository.\\n\\nYou can use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/#install>`_ to run code style checks\\nbefore each commit::\\n\\n    pip install pre-commit\\n    pre-commit install\\n\\npre-commit checks can be disabled for a single commit with::\\n\\n    git commit -n\\n\\nRunning the test suite\\n======================\\n\\nTo run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.\\nRun the test suite using::\\n\\n    pytest joblib\\n\\nfrom the root of the project.\\n\\nBuilding the docs\\n=================\\n\\nTo build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4) and some dependencies\\ninstalled::\\n\\n    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txt\\n\\nThe docs can then be built with the following command::\\n\\n    make doc\\n\\nThe html docs are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.\\n\\n\\nMaking a source tarball\\n=======================\\n\\nTo create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the\\nfollowing command::\\n\\n    pip install build\\n    python -m build --sdist\\n\\nThe tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will create\\nthe resulting tarball that can be installed with no extra dependencies than the\\nPython standard library.\\n\\nMaking a release and uploading it to PyPI\\n=========================================\\n\\nThis command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and\\nupload in to PyPI::\\n\\n    pip install build\\n    python -m build --sdist --wheel\\n    twine upload dist/*\\n\\n\\nNote that the documentation should automatically get updated at each git\\npush. If that is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolve\\nany doc build error (in particular when running the examples).\\n\\nUpdating the changelog\\n======================\\n\\nChanges are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updated\\nbut, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::\\n\\n    git log --abbrev-commit --date=short --no-merges --sparse\\n\",\n",

For example,\\n\\n1. A method that is added to a superclass is shadowed by an existing method with the same name in a \\n   subclass.\\n\\n2. A method of a superclass that is overridden by a subclass is renamed in the superclass but not in \\n   the subclass.\\n\\n3. A method of a superclass that is overridden by a subclass is removed in the superclass but not in\\n   the subclass.\\n\\n4. A method of a superclass that is overridden by a subclass but the signature of the overridden\\n   method is incompatible with that of the inherited one.\\n\\nThese can be only checked by explicitly marking method override in the code.\\n\\nPython also has no standard mechanism by which to inherit docstrings in overridden methods. Because \\nmost standard linters (e.g., flake8) have rules that require all public methods to have a docstring, \\nthis inevitably leads to a proliferation of ``See parent class for usage`` docstrings on overridden\\nmethods, or, worse, to a disabling of these rules altogether. In addition, mediocre or missing\\ndocstrings degrade the quality of tooltips and completions that can be provided by an editor.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nCompatible with Python 3.6+.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ pip install overrides\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nUse ``@override`` to indicate that a subclass method should override a superclass method.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from overrides import override\\n\\n    class SuperClass:\\n\\n        def foo(self):\\n            \\\"\\\"\\\"This docstring will be inherited by any method that overrides this!\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n            return 1\\n\\n        def bar(self, x) -> str:\\n            return x\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        @override\\n        def foo(self):\\n            return 2\\n\\n        @override\\n        def bar(self, y) -> int: # Raises, because the signature is not compatible.\\n            return y\\n            \\n        @override\\n        def zoo(self): # Raises, because does not exist in the super class.\\n            return \\\"foobarzoo\\\"\\n\\nUse ``EnforceOverrides`` to require subclass methods that shadow superclass methods to be decorated \\nwith ``@override``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n \\n    from overrides import EnforceOverrides\\n\\n    class SuperClass(EnforceOverrides):\\n\\n        def foo(self):\\n            return 1\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        def foo(self): # Raises, because @override is missing.\\n            return 2\\n\\nUse ``@final`` to indicate that a superclass method cannot be overriden.\\nWith Python 3.11 and above ``@final`` is directly `typing.final <https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/typing.html#typing.final>`_.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from overrides import EnforceOverrides, final, override\\n\\n    class SuperClass(EnforceOverrides):\\n\\n        @final\\n        def foo(self):\\n            return 1\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        @override\\n        def foo(self): # Raises, because overriding a final method is forbidden.\\n            return 2\\n\\nNote that ``@classmethod`` and ``@staticmethod`` must be declared before ``@override``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from overrides import override\\n\\n    class SuperClass:\\n\\n        @staticmethod\\n        def foo(x):\\n            return 1\\n\\n    class SubClass(SuperClass):\\n\\n        @staticmethod\\n        @override\\n        def foo(x):\\n            return 2\\n\\n\\nFlags of control\\n----------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    # To prevent all signature checks do:\\n    @override(check_signature=False)\\n    def some_method(self, now_this_can_be_funny_and_wrong: str, what_ever: int) -> \\\"Dictirux\\\":\\n        pass\\n\\n    # To do the check only at runtime and solve some forward reference problems\\n    @override(check_at_runtime=True)\\n    def some_other_method(self, ..) -> \\\"SomethingDefinedLater\\\":\\n        pass\\n\\n    a.some_other_method() # Kaboom if not SomethingDefinedLater\\n\\n\\nContributors\\n------------\\n\\nThis project exists only through the work of all the people who contribute.\\n\\nmkorpela, drorasaf, ngoodman90, TylerYep, leeopop, donpatrice, jayvdb, joelgrus, lisyarus, \\nsoulmerge, rkr-at-dbx, ashwin153, brentyi,  jobh, tjsmart, bersbersbers, LysanderGG, mgorny.\\n\",\n",

Stay tuned.\\n- There's a WIP PEP8 validator. It's however not in a good shape, yet.\\n\\nKnown Issues\\n============\\n\\n- `async`/`await` are already used as keywords in Python3.6.\\n- `from __future__ import print_function` is not ignored.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n================\\n\\n- Guido van Rossum (@gvanrossum) for creating the parser generator pgen2\\n  (originally used in lib2to3).\\n- `Salome Schneider <https://www.crepes-schnaegg.ch/cr%C3%AApes-schn%C3%A4gg/kunst-f%C3%BCrs-cr%C3%AApes-mobil/>`_\\n  for the extremely awesome parso logo.\\n\\n\\n.. _jedi: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi\\n\\n\\n.. :changelog:\\n\\nChangelog\\n---------\\n\\nUnreleased\\n++++++++++\\n\\n0.8.4 (2024-04-05)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Add basic support for Python 3.13\\n\\n0.8.3 (2021-11-30)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Add basic support for Python 3.11 and 3.12\\n\\n0.8.2 (2021-03-30)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Various small bugfixes\\n\\n0.8.1 (2020-12-10)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Various small bugfixes\\n\\n0.8.0 (2020-08-05)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Dropped Support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5\\n- It's possible to use ``pathlib.Path`` objects now in the API\\n- The stubs are gone, we are now using annotations\\n- ``namedexpr_test`` nodes are now a proper class called ``NamedExpr``\\n- A lot of smaller refactorings\\n\\n0.7.1 (2020-07-24)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed a couple of smaller bugs (mostly syntax error detection in\\n  ``Grammar.iter_errors``)\\n\\nThis is going to be the last release that supports Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.\\n\\n0.7.0 (2020-04-13)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fix a lot of annoying bugs in the diff parser.

Colorama makes this work on\\nWindows, too, by wrapping ``stdout``, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which\\nwould appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the\\nappropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,\\nColorama does nothing.\\n\\nThis has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing\\ncolored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing\\napplications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on\\nLinux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling\\n``colorama.just_fix_windows_console()`` (since v0.4.6) or ``colorama.init()``\\n(all versions, but may have other side-effects – see below).\\n\\nAn alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows machines, which\\nprovides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals. Colorama\\nis intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g., maybe your app doesn't\\nhave an installer.)\\n\\nDemo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using\\nANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's built in ANSI\\nhandling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/ubuntu-demo.png\\n    :width: 661\\n    :height: 357\\n    :alt: ANSI sequences on Ubuntu under gnome-terminal.\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/windows-demo.png\\n    :width: 668\\n    :height: 325\\n    :alt: Same ANSI sequences on Windows, using Colorama.\\n\\nThese screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support ANSI 'dim\\ntext'; it looks the same as 'normal text'.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nInitialisation\\n..............\\n\\nIf the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work on\\nWindows, then run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\\n    just_fix_windows_console()\\n\\nIf you're on a recent version of Windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr\\nare pointing to a Windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration\\nswitch to enable Windows' built-in ANSI support.\\n\\nIf you're on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to\\na Windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr`` in a\\nmagic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues the\\nappropriate Win32 calls to emulate them.\\n\\nIn all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. Basically the idea is\\nthat this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to ANSI escape handling.\\n\\nIt's safe to call this function multiple times. It's safe to call this function\\non non-Windows platforms, but it won't do anything. It's safe to call this\\nfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file – it\\nwon't do anything to those streams.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more\\npotential footguns):\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import init\\n    init()\\n\\nThis does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for the\\nfollowing differences:\\n\\n- It's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up with multiple\\n  layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.\\n\\n- Colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,\\n  and if it thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and\\n  ``sys.stderr`` in a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences\\n  before printing them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if\\n  you want to write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and\\n  let Colorama decide whether they should actually be output. But note that\\n  Colorama's heuristic is not particularly clever.\\n\\n- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various\\n  functionality – see below.\\n\\nTo stop using Colorama before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.\\nThis will restore ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to their original values, so that\\nColorama is disabled. To resume using Colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it is\\ncheaper than calling ``init()`` again (but does the same thing).\\n\\nMost users should depend on ``colorama >= 0.4.6``, and use\\n``just_fix_windows_console``. The old ``init`` interface will be supported\\nindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to fix any issues\\nwith it, also for backwards compatibility.\\n\\nColored Output\\n..............\\n\\nCross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama's\\nconstant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberately\\nrudimentary, see below.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import Fore, Back, Style\\n    print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\\n    print(Back.GREEN + 'and with a green background')\\n    print(Style.DIM + 'and in dim text')\\n    print(Style.RESET_ALL)\\n    print('back to normal now')\\n\\n...or simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    print('\\\\033[31m' + 'some red text')\\n    print('\\\\033[39m') # and reset to default color\\n\\n...or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ANSI libraries\\nsuch as the venerable `Termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_\\nthe fabulous `Blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,\\nor the incredible `_Rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.\\n\\nIf you wish Colorama's Fore, Back and Style constants were more capable,\\nthen consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate\\ncolors, etc, and use Colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert\\nthose ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:\\n\\nSIMILARLY, do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.\\nWe are only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, not\\nshortcuts like the above to generate ANSI characters.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\\n    from termcolor import colored\\n\\n    # use Colorama to make Termcolor work on Windows too\\n    just_fix_windows_console()\\n\\n    # then use Termcolor for all colored text output\\n    print(colored('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red'))\\n\\nAvailable formatting constants are::\\n\\n    Fore: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\\n    Back: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\\n    Style: DIM, NORMAL, BRIGHT, RESET_ALL\\n\\n``Style.RESET_ALL`` resets foreground, background, and brightness. Colorama will\\nperform this reset automatically on program exit.\\n\\nThese are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard::\\n\\n    Fore: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\\n    Back: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\\n\\nCursor Positioning\\n..................\\n\\nANSI codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See ``demos/demo06.py`` for\\nan example of how to generate them.\\n\\nInit Keyword Args\\n.................\\n\\n``init()`` accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.\\n\\ninit(autoreset=False):\\n    If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color\\n    changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=True)`` will\\n    automate that:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: python\\n\\n        from colorama import init\\n        init(autoreset=True)\\n        print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\\n        print('automatically back to default color again')\\n\\ninit(strip=None):\\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether ANSI codes should be\\n    stripped from the output. The default behaviour is to strip if on Windows\\n    or if output is redirected (not a tty).\\n\\ninit(convert=None):\\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether to convert ANSI codes in the\\n    output into win32 calls. The default behaviour is to convert if on Windows\\n    and output is to a tty (terminal).\\n\\ninit(wrap=True):\\n    On Windows, Colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``\\n    with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their work.\\n    If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing\\n    ``init(wrap=False)``. The default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset`` or\\n    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are True.\\n\\n    When wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-Windows platforms will\\n    continue to work as normal. To do cross-platform colored output, you can\\n    use Colorama's ``AnsiToWin32`` proxy directly:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: python\\n\\n        import sys\\n        from colorama import init, AnsiToWin32\\n        init(wrap=False)\\n        stream = AnsiToWin32(sys.stderr).stream\\n\\n        # Python 2\\n        print >>stream, Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr'\\n\\n        # Python 3\\n        print(Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)\\n\\nRecognised ANSI Sequences\\n.........................\\n\\nANSI sequences generally take the form::\\n\\n    ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>\\n\\nWhere ``<param>`` is an integer, and ``<command>`` is a single letter. Zero or\\nmore params are passed to a ``<command>``. If no params are passed, it is\\ngenerally synonymous with passing a single zero. No spaces exist in the\\nsequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.\\n\\nThe only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls are::\\n\\n    ESC [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)\\n    ESC [ 1 m       # bright\\n    ESC [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)\\n    ESC [ 22 m      # normal brightness\\n\\n    # FOREGROUND:\\n    ESC [ 30 m      # black\\n    ESC [ 31 m      # red\\n    ESC [ 32 m      # green\\n    ESC [ 33 m      # yellow\\n    ESC [ 34 m      # blue\\n    ESC [ 35 m      # magenta\\n    ESC [ 36 m      # cyan\\n    ESC [ 37 m      # white\\n    ESC [ 39 m      # reset\\n\\n    # BACKGROUND\\n    ESC [ 40 m      # black\\n    ESC [ 41 m      # red\\n    ESC [ 42 m      # green\\n    ESC [ 43 m      # yellow\\n    ESC [ 44 m      # blue\\n    ESC [ 45 m      # magenta\\n    ESC [ 46 m      # cyan\\n    ESC [ 47 m      # white\\n    ESC [ 49 m      # reset\\n\\n    # cursor positioning\\n    ESC [ y;x H     # position cursor at x across, y down\\n    ESC [ y;x f     # position cursor at x across, y down\\n    ESC [ n A       # move cursor n lines up\\n    ESC [ n B       # move cursor n lines down\\n    ESC [ n C       # move cursor n characters forward\\n    ESC [ n D       # move cursor n characters backward\\n\\n    # clear the screen\\n    ESC [ mode J    # clear the screen\\n\\n    # clear the line\\n    ESC [ mode K    # clear the line\\n\\nMultiple numeric params to the ``'m'`` command can be combined into a single\\nsequence::\\n\\n    ESC [ 36 ; 45 ; 1 m     # bright cyan text on magenta background\\n\\nAll other ANSI sequences of the form ``ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>``\\nare silently stripped from the output on Windows.\\n\\nAny other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative\\ninitial characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to add\\nthem though. Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues on\\nGitHub.\\n\\nStatus & Known Problems\\n-----------------------\\n\\nI've personally only tested it on Windows XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu\\n(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.\\n\\nSome valid ANSI sequences aren't recognised.\\n\\nIf you're hacking on the code, see `README-hacking.md`_. ESPECIALLY, see the\\nexplanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow Colorama to generate new\\ntypes of ANSI codes.\\n\\nSee outstanding issues and wish-list:\\nhttps://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues\\n\\nIf anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,\\nI'd love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,\\nand would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patch\\nor two.\\n\\n.. _README-hacking.md: README-hacking.md\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\nCopyright Jonathan Hartley & Arnon Yaari, 2013-2020.

The _prebuilt_ extensions can be distributed\\nvia [PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=jupyterlab&o=-created&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter),\\nconda, and other package managers. The _source_ extensions can be installed\\ndirectly from npm (search for [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension)) but require an additional build step.\\nYou can also find JupyterLab extensions exploring GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension).\\nTo learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).\\n\\nRead the current JupyterLab documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\\n\\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n> JupyterLab 3 reached its end of maintenance date on May 15, 2024. Fixes for critical issues will still be backported until December 31, 2024. If you are still running JupyterLab 3, we strongly encourage you to **upgrade to JupyterLab 4 as soon as possible.** For more information, see [JupyterLab 3 end of maintenance](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-3-end-of-maintenance-879778927db2) on the Jupyter Blog.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nIf you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), you can install JupyterLab with one of the following commands.\\n\\n- If you use conda:\\n  ```shell\\n  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\\n  ```\\n- If you use mamba:\\n  ```shell\\n  mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\\n  ```\\n- If you use pip:\\n  ```shell\\n  pip install jupyterlab\\n  ```\\n  If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`. If you are using a Unix derivative (e.g., FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, macOS), you can do this by running `export PATH=\\\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\\\"`.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook\\n\\nWhen using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run after installing JupyterLab to enable the JupyterLab server extension:\\n\\n```bash\\njupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix\\n```\\n\\n### Running\\n\\nStart up JupyterLab using:\\n\\n```bash\\njupyter lab\\n```\\n\\nJupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.\\n\\nIf you encounter an error like \\\"Command 'jupyter' not found\\\", please make sure `PATH` environment variable is set correctly. Alternatively, you can start up JupyterLab using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab` without changing the `PATH` environment variable.\\n\\n### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers\\n\\nThe latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:\\n\\n- Firefox\\n- Chrome\\n- Safari\\n\\nSee our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting help\\n\\nWe encourage you to ask questions on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.\\n\\n### Bug report\\n\\nTo report a bug please read the [guidelines](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/issue.html) and then open a [Github issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+status%3ANeeds+Triage&template=bug_report.md).

The next time, the cached will be loaded and returned.\\n\\nWhen the source is changed, the DiskCache detects that the cached\\nfile is older, calls `parse` again storing and returning the new\\nresult.\\n\\nIn certain cases you would rather detect that the file has changed\\nby hashing the file. Simply use `DiskCacheByHash` instead of\\n`DiskCacheByMTime`.\\n\\nCached files are saved using the pickle protocol, and each has\\na companion json file with the header content.\\n\\nThis idea is completely flexible, and apply not only to parser.\\nIn **flexcache** we say there are two types of objects: **source object**\\nand **converted object**. The conversion function maps the former in\\nto the latter. The cache stores the latter by looking a customizable\\naspect of the former.\\n\\n\\nBuilding your own caching logic\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nIn certain cases you would like to customize how caching and\\ninvalidation is done.\\n\\nYou can achieve this by subclassing the `DiskCache`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from flexcache import DiskCache\\n    >>> class MyDiskCache(DiskCache):\\n    ...\\n    ...    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    ...    class MyHeader(NameByPathHeader, InvalidateByExist, BasicPythonHeader):\\n    ...         pass\\n    ...\\n    ...    _header_classes = {pathlib.Path: MyHeader}\\n\\nHere we created a custom Header class and use it to handle `pathlib.Path`\\nobjects. You can even have multiple headers registered in the same class\\nto handle different source object types.\\n\\nWe provide a convenient set of mixable classes to achieve almost any behavior.\\nThese are divided in three categories and you must choose at least one\\nfrom every kind.\\n\\nHeaders\\n~~~~~~~\\n\\nThese classes store the information that will be saved along side the cached file.\\n\\n- **BaseHeader**: source object and identifier of the converter function.\\n- **BasicPythonHeader**: source and identifier of the converter function,\\n  platform, python implementation, python version.\\n\\n\\nInvalidate\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThese classes define how the cache will decide if the cached converted object is an actual\\nrepresentation of the source object.\\n\\n- **InvalidateByExist**: the cached file must exists.\\n- **InvalidateByPathMTime**: the cached file exists and is newer than the source object\\n  (which has to be `pathlib.Path`)\\n- **InvalidateByMultiPathsMtime**: the cached file exists and is newer than the each path\\n  in the source object (which has to be `tuple[pathlib.Path]`)\\n\\n\\nNaming\\n~~~~~~\\n\\nThese classes define how the name is generated. The basename for the cache file is\\na hash hexdigest built by feeding a collection of values determined by the Header object.\\n\\n- **NameByFields**: all fields except the `source_object`.\\n- **NameByPath**: resolved path of the source object\\n  (which has to be `pathlib.Path`).\\n- **NameByMultiPaths**: resolved path of each path source object\\n  (which has to be `tuple[pathlib.Path]`), sorted in ascending order.\\n- **NameByFileContent**: the bytes content of the file referred by the source object\\n  (which has to be `pathlib.Path`).\\n- **NameByHashIter**: the values in the source object.\\n  (which has to be `tuple[str]`), sorted in ascending order\\n- **NameByObj**: the pickled version of the source object\\n  (which has to be pickable), using the highest available protocol.\\n  This also adds `pickle_protocol` to the header.\\n\\n\\nYou can mix and match as you see it fit, and of course, you can make your own.\\n\\nFinally, you can also avoid saving the header by setting the `_store_header`\\nclass attribute to `False`.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThis project was started as a part of Pint_, the python units package.\\n\\nSee AUTHORS_ for a list of the maintainers.\\n\\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\\nsee CHANGES_\\n\\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexcache/blob/main/AUTHORS\\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexcache/blob/main/CHANGES\\n.. _`Pint`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"![Build Status](https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)\\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/python-json-logger.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json-logger/)\\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/python-json-logger.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json-logger/)\\n\\nOverview\\n=======\\nThis library is provided to allow standard python logging to output log data as json objects. With JSON we can make our logs more readable by machines and we can stop writing custom parsers for syslog type records.\\n\\nNews\\n=======\\nHi, I see this package is quiet alive and I am sorry for ignoring it so long. I will be stepping up my maintenance of this package so please allow me a week to get things back in order (and most likely a new minor version) and I'll post and update here once I am caught up.\\n\\nInstalling\\n==========\\nPip:\\n\\n    pip install python-json-logger\\n\\nPypi:\\n\\n   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json-logger\\n\\nManual:\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\nUsage\\n=====\\n\\n## Integrating with Python's logging framework\\n\\nJson outputs are provided by the JsonFormatter logging formatter. You can add the custom formatter like below:\\n\\n**Please note: version 0.1.0 has changed the import structure, please update to the following example for proper importing**\\n\\n```python\\n    import logging\\n    from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger\\n\\n    logger = logging.getLogger()\\n\\n    logHandler = logging.StreamHandler()\\n    formatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter()\\n    logHandler.setFormatter(formatter)\\n    logger.addHandler(logHandler)\\n```\\n\\n## Customizing fields\\n\\nThe fmt parser can also be overidden if you want to have required fields that differ from the default of just `message`.\\n\\nThese two invocations are equivalent:\\n\\n```python\\nclass CustomJsonFormatter(jsonlogger.JsonFormatter):\\n    def parse(self):\\n        return self._fmt.split(';')\\n\\nformatter = CustomJsonFormatter('one;two')\\n\\n# is equivalent to:\\n\\nformatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter('%(one)s %(two)s')\\n```\\n\\nYou can also add extra fields to your json output by specifying a dict in place of message, as well as by specifying an `extra={}` argument.\\n\\nContents of these dictionaries will be added at the root level of the entry and may override basic fields.\\n\\nYou can also use the `add_fields` method to add to or generally normalize the set of default set of fields, it is called for every log event. For example, to unify default fields with those provided by [structlog](http://www.structlog.org/) you could do something like this:\\n\\n```python\\nclass CustomJsonFormatter(jsonlogger.JsonFormatter):\\n    def add_fields(self, log_record, record, message_dict):\\n        super(CustomJsonFormatter, self).add_fields(log_record, record, message_dict)\\n        if not log_record.get('timestamp'):\\n            # this doesn't use record.created, so it is slightly off\\n            now = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')\\n            log_record['timestamp'] = now\\n        if log_record.get('level'):\\n            log_record['level'] = log_record['level'].upper()\\n        else:\\n            log_record['level'] = record.levelname\\n\\nformatter = CustomJsonFormatter('%(timestamp)s %(level)s %(name)s %(message)s')\\n```\\n\\nItems added to the log record will be included in *every* log message, no matter what the format requires.\\n\\n## Adding custom object serialization\\n\\nFor custom handling of object serialization you can specify default json object translator or provide a custom encoder\\n\\n```python\\ndef json_translate(obj):\\n    if isinstance(obj, MyClass):\\n        return {\\\"special\\\": obj.special}\\n\\nformatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter(json_default=json_translate,\\n                                     json_encoder=json.JSONEncoder)\\nlogHandler.setFormatter(formatter)\\n\\nlogger.info({\\\"special\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"run\\\": 12})\\nlogger.info(\\\"classic message\\\", extra={\\\"special\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"run\\\": 12})\\n```\\n\\n## Using a Config File\\n\\nTo use the module with a config file using the [`fileConfig` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.fileConfig), use the class `pythonjsonlogger.jsonlogger.JsonFormatter`. Here is a sample config file.\\n\\n```ini\\n[loggers]\\nkeys = root,custom\\n\\n[logger_root]\\nhandlers =\\n\\n[logger_custom]\\nlevel = INFO\\nhandlers = custom\\nqualname = custom\\n\\n[handlers]\\nkeys = custom\\n\\n[handler_custom]\\nclass = StreamHandler\\nlevel = INFO\\nformatter = json\\nargs = (sys.stdout,)\\n\\n[formatters]\\nkeys = json\\n\\n[formatter_json]\\nformat = %(message)s\\nclass = pythonjsonlogger.jsonlogger.JsonFormatter\\n```\\n\\nExample Output\\n==============\\n\\nSample JSON with a full formatter (basically the log message from the unit test). Every log message will appear on 1 line like a typical logger.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"threadName\\\": \\\"MainThread\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"root\\\",\\n    \\\"thread\\\": 140735202359648,\\n    \\\"created\\\": 1336281068.506248,\\n    \\\"process\\\": 41937,\\n    \\\"processName\\\": \\\"MainProcess\\\",\\n    \\\"relativeCreated\\\": 9.100914001464844,\\n    \\\"module\\\": \\\"tests\\\",\\n    \\\"funcName\\\": \\\"testFormatKeys\\\",\\n    \\\"levelno\\\": 20,\\n    \\\"msecs\\\": 506.24799728393555,\\n    \\\"pathname\\\": \\\"tests/tests.py\\\",\\n    \\\"lineno\\\": 60,\\n    \\\"asctime\\\": [\\\"12-05-05 22:11:08,506248\\\"],\\n    \\\"message\\\": \\\"testing logging format\\\",\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"tests.py\\\",\\n    \\\"levelname\\\": \\\"INFO\\\",\\n    \\\"special\\\": \\\"value\\\",\\n    \\\"run\\\": 12\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExternal Examples\\n=================\\n\\n- [Wesley Tanaka - Structured log files in Python using python-json-logger](http://web.archive.org/web/20201130054012/https://wtanaka.com/node/8201)\\n\\n- [Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130054012/https://wtanaka.com/node/8201)\\n\",\n",

It implements trio-like `structured concurrency`_ (SC) on top of asyncio and works in harmony\\nwith the native SC of trio itself.\\n\\nApplications and libraries written against AnyIO's API will run unmodified on either asyncio_ or\\ntrio_. AnyIO can also be adopted into a library or application incrementally – bit by bit, no full\\nrefactoring necessary. It will blend in with the native libraries of your chosen backend.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nView full documentation at: https://anyio.readthedocs.io/\\n\\nFeatures\\n--------\\n\\nAnyIO offers the following functionality:\\n\\n* Task groups (nurseries_ in trio terminology)\\n* High-level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)\\n\\n  * `Happy eyeballs`_ algorithm for TCP connections (more robust than that of asyncio on Python\\n    3.8)\\n  * async/await style UDP sockets (unlike asyncio where you still have to use Transports and\\n    Protocols)\\n\\n* A versatile API for byte streams and object streams\\n* Inter-task synchronization and communication (locks, conditions, events, semaphores, object\\n  streams)\\n* Worker threads\\n* Subprocesses\\n* Asynchronous file I/O (using worker threads)\\n* Signal handling\\n\\nAnyIO also comes with its own pytest_ plugin which also supports asynchronous fixtures.\\nIt even works with the popular Hypothesis_ library.\\n\\n.. _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\\n.. _trio: https://github.com/python-trio/trio\\n.. _structured concurrency: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency\\n.. _nurseries: https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-core.html#nurseries-and-spawning\\n.. _Happy eyeballs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs\\n.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/\\n.. _Hypothesis: https://hypothesis.works/\\n\",\n",

An attacker can also keep\\nCPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request. Under some\\ncircumstances it is even possible to access local files on your\\nserver, to circumvent a firewall, or to abuse services to rebound attacks to\\nthird parties.\\n\\nThe attacks use and abuse less common features of XML and its parsers. The\\nmajority of developers are unacquainted with features such as processing\\ninstructions and entity expansions that XML inherited from SGML. At best\\nthey know about ``<!DOCTYPE>`` from experience with HTML but they are not\\naware that a document type definition (DTD) can generate an HTTP request\\nor load a file from the file system.\\n\\nNone of the issues is new. They have been known for a long time. Billion\\nlaughs was first reported in 2003. Nevertheless some XML libraries and\\napplications are still vulnerable and even heavy users of XML are\\nsurprised by these features. It's hard to say whom to blame for the\\nsituation. It's too short sighted to shift all blame on XML parsers and\\nXML libraries for using insecure default settings. After all they\\nproperly implement XML specifications. Application developers must not rely\\nthat a library is always configured for security and potential harmful data\\nby default.\\n\\n\\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\\n   :depth: 2\\n\\n\\nAttack vectors\\n==============\\n\\nbillion laughs / exponential entity expansion\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe `Billion Laughs`_ attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion --\\nuses multiple levels of nested entities. The original example uses 9 levels\\nof 10 expansions in each level to expand the string ``lol`` to a string of\\n3 * 10 :sup:`9` bytes, hence the name \\\"billion laughs\\\". The resulting string\\noccupies 3 GB (2.79 GiB) of memory; intermediate strings require additional\\nmemory. Because most parsers don't cache the intermediate step for every\\nexpansion it is repeated over and over again. It increases the CPU load even\\nmore.\\n\\nAn XML document of just a few hundred bytes can disrupt all services on a\\nmachine within seconds.\\n\\nExample XML::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [\\n    <!ENTITY a \\\"1234567890\\\" >\\n    <!ENTITY b \\\"&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;\\\">\\n    <!ENTITY c \\\"&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;\\\">\\n    <!ENTITY d \\\"&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <bomb>&d;</bomb>\\n\\n\\nquadratic blowup entity expansion\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nA quadratic blowup attack is similar to a `Billion Laughs`_ attack; it abuses\\nentity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entity\\nwith a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack isn't as\\nefficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering countermeasures of\\nparsers against heavily nested entities. Some parsers limit the depth and\\nbreadth of a single entity but not the total amount of expanded text\\nthroughout an entire XML document.\\n\\nA medium-sized XML document with a couple of hundred kilobytes can require a\\ncouple of hundred MB to several GB of memory. When the attack is combined\\nwith some level of nested expansion an attacker is able to achieve a higher\\nratio of success.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE bomb [\\n    <!ENTITY a \\\"xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <bomb>&a;&a;&a;... repeat</bomb>\\n\\n\\nexternal entity expansion (remote)\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nEntity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They can\\nalso point to external resources by public identifiers or system identifiers.\\nSystem identifiers are standard URIs. When the URI is a URL (e.g. a\\n``http://`` locator) some parsers download the resource from the remote\\nlocation and embed them into the XML document verbatim.\\n\\nSimple example of a parsed external entity::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE external [\\n    <!ENTITY ee SYSTEM \\\"http://www.python.org/some.xml\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <root>&ee;</root>\\n\\nThe case of parsed external entities works only for valid XML content. The\\nXML standard also supports unparsed external entities with a\\n``NData declaration``.\\n\\nExternal entity expansion opens the door to plenty of exploits. An attacker\\ncan abuse a vulnerable XML library and application to rebound and forward\\nnetwork requests with the IP address of the server. It highly depends\\non the parser and the application what kind of exploit is possible. For\\nexample:\\n\\n* An attacker can circumvent firewalls and gain access to restricted\\n  resources as all the requests are made from an internal and trustworthy\\n  IP address, not from the outside.\\n* An attacker can abuse a service to attack, spy on or DoS your servers but\\n  also third party services. The attack is disguised with the IP address of\\n  the server and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big\\n  machine.\\n* An attacker can exhaust additional resources on the machine, e.g. with\\n  requests to a service that doesn't respond or responds with very large\\n  files.\\n* An attacker may gain knowledge, when, how often and from which IP address\\n  an XML document is accessed.\\n* An attacker could send mail from inside your network if the URL handler\\n  supports ``smtp://`` URIs.\\n\\n\\nexternal entity expansion (local file)\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nExternal entities with references to local files are a sub-case of external\\nentity expansion. It's listed as an extra attack because it deserves extra\\nattention. Some XML libraries such as lxml disable network access by default\\nbut still allow entity expansion with local file access by default. Local\\nfiles are either referenced with a ``file://`` URL or by a file path (either\\nrelative or absolute).\\n\\nAn attacker may be able to access and download all files that can be read by\\nthe application process. This may include critical configuration files, too.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    <!DOCTYPE external [\\n    <!ENTITY ee SYSTEM \\\"file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml\\\">\\n    ]>\\n    <root>&ee;</root>\\n\\n\\nDTD retrieval\\n-------------\\n\\nThis case is similar to external entity expansion, too. Some XML libraries\\nlike Python's xml.dom.pulldom retrieve document type definitions from remote\\nor local locations. Several attack scenarios from the external entity case\\napply to this issue as well.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    <?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\\\"\\n      \\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\\\">\\n    <html>\\n        <head/>\\n        <body>text</body>\\n    </html>\\n\\n\\nPython XML Libraries\\n====================\\n\\n.. csv-table:: vulnerabilities and features\\n   :header: \\\"kind\\\", \\\"sax\\\", \\\"etree\\\", \\\"minidom\\\", \\\"pulldom\\\", \\\"xmlrpc\\\", \\\"lxml\\\", \\\"genshi\\\"\\n   :widths: 24, 7, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8\\n   :stub-columns: 0\\n\\n   \\\"billion laughs\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (1)\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"quadratic blowup\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"external entity expansion (remote)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (3)\\\", \\\"False (4)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"False (1)\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"external entity expansion (local file)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (3)\\\", \\\"False (4)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False (5)\\\"\\n   \\\"DTD retrieval\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"False (1)\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"gzip bomb\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"**partly** (2)\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"xpath support (7)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"xsl(t) support (7)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True**\\\", \\\"False\\\"\\n   \\\"xinclude support (7)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True** (6)\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"**True** (6)\\\", \\\"**True**\\\"\\n   \\\"C library\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"expat\\\", \\\"libxml2\\\", \\\"expat\\\"\\n\\n1. Lxml is protected against billion laughs attacks and doesn't do network\\n   lookups by default.\\n2. libxml2 and lxml are not directly vulnerable to gzip decompression bombs\\n   but they don't protect you against them either.\\n3. xml.etree doesn't expand entities and raises a ParserError when an entity\\n   occurs.\\n4. minidom doesn't expand entities and simply returns the unexpanded entity\\n   verbatim.\\n5. genshi.input of genshi 0.6 doesn't support entity expansion and raises a\\n   ParserError when an entity occurs.\\n6. Library has (limited) XInclude support but requires an additional step to\\n   process inclusion.\\n7. These are features but they may introduce exploitable holes, see\\n   `Other things to consider`_\\n\\n\\nSettings in standard library\\n----------------------------\\n\\n\\nxml.sax.handler Features\\n........................\\n\\nfeature_external_ges (http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities)\\n  disables external entity expansion\\n\\nfeature_external_pes (http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities)\\n  the option is ignored and doesn't modify any functionality\\n\\nDOM xml.dom.xmlbuilder.Options\\n..............................\\n\\nexternal_parameter_entities\\n  ignored\\n\\nexternal_general_entities\\n  ignored\\n\\nexternal_dtd_subset\\n  ignored\\n\\nentities\\n  unsure\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml\\n==========\\n\\nThe `defusedxml package`_ (`defusedxml on PyPI`_)\\ncontains several Python-only workarounds and fixes\\nfor denial of service and other vulnerabilities in Python's XML libraries.\\nIn order to benefit from the protection you just have to import and use the\\nlisted functions / classes from the right defusedxml module instead of the\\noriginal module. Merely `defusedxml.xmlrpc`_ is implemented as monkey patch.\\n\\nInstead of::\\n\\n   >>> from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse\\n   >>> et = parse(xmlfile)\\n\\nalter code to::\\n\\n   >>> from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse\\n   >>> et = parse(xmlfile)\\n\\nAdditionally the package has an **untested** function to monkey patch\\nall stdlib modules with ``defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()``.\\n\\nAll functions and parser classes accept three additional keyword arguments.\\nThey return either the same objects as the original functions or compatible\\nsubclasses.\\n\\nforbid_dtd (default: False)\\n  disallow XML with a ``<!DOCTYPE>`` processing instruction and raise a\\n  *DTDForbidden* exception when a DTD processing instruction is found.\\n\\nforbid_entities (default: True)\\n  disallow XML with ``<!ENTITY>`` declarations inside the DTD and raise an\\n  *EntitiesForbidden* exception when an entity is declared.\\n\\nforbid_external (default: True)\\n  disallow any access to remote or local resources in external entities\\n  or DTD and raising an *ExternalReferenceForbidden* exception when a DTD\\n  or entity references an external resource.\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml (package)\\n--------------------\\n\\nDefusedXmlException, DTDForbidden, EntitiesForbidden,\\nExternalReferenceForbidden, NotSupportedError\\n\\ndefuse_stdlib() (*experimental*)\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml.cElementTree\\n-----------------------\\n\\n**NOTE** ``defusedxml.cElementTree`` is deprecated and will be removed in a\\nfuture release.

The function `monkey_patch()` enables the fixes,\\n`unmonkey_patch()` removes the patch and puts the code in its former state.\\n\\nThe monkey patch protects against XML related attacks as well as\\ndecompression bombs and excessively large requests or responses. The default\\nsetting is 30 MB for requests, responses and gzip decompression. You can\\nmodify the default by changing the module variable `MAX_DATA`. A value of\\n`-1` disables the limit.\\n\\n\\ndefusedxml.lxml\\n---------------\\n\\n**DEPRECATED** The module is deprecated and will be removed in a future\\nrelease.\\n\\nThe module acts as an *example* how you could protect code that uses\\nlxml.etree. It implements a custom Element class that filters out\\nEntity instances, a custom parser factory and a thread local storage for\\nparser instances. It also has a check_docinfo() function which inspects\\na tree for internal or external DTDs and entity declarations. In order to\\ncheck for entities lxml > 3.0 is required.\\n\\nparse(), fromstring()\\nRestrictedElement, GlobalParserTLS, getDefaultParser(), check_docinfo()\\n\\n\\ndefusedexpat\\n============\\n\\nThe `defusedexpat package`_ (`defusedexpat on PyPI`_)\\ncomes with binary extensions and a\\n`modified expat`_ library instead of the standard `expat parser`_. It's\\nbasically a stand-alone version of the patches for Python's standard\\nlibrary C extensions.\\n\\nModifications in expat\\n----------------------\\n\\nnew definitions::\\n\\n  XML_BOMB_PROTECTION\\n  XML_DEFAULT_MAX_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS\\n  XML_DEFAULT_MAX_ENTITY_EXPANSIONS\\n  XML_DEFAULT_RESET_DTD\\n\\nnew XML_FeatureEnum members::\\n\\n  XML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS\\n  XML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_EXPANSIONS\\n  XML_FEATURE_IGNORE_DTD\\n\\nnew XML_Error members::\\n\\n  XML_ERROR_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS\\n  XML_ERROR_ENTITY_EXPANSION\\n\\nnew API functions::\\n\\n  int XML_GetFeature(XML_Parser parser,\\n                     enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,\\n                     long *value);\\n  int XML_SetFeature(XML_Parser parser,\\n                     enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,\\n                     long value);\\n  int XML_GetFeatureDefault(enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,\\n                            long *value);\\n  int XML_SetFeatureDefault(enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,\\n                            long value);\\n\\nXML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS\\n   Limit the amount of indirections that are allowed to occur during the\\n   expansion of a nested entity. A counter starts when an entity reference\\n   is encountered. It resets after the entity is fully expanded. The limit\\n   protects the parser against exponential entity expansion attacks (aka\\n   billion laughs attack). When the limit is exceeded the parser stops and\\n   fails with `XML_ERROR_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS`.\\n   A value of 0 disables the protection.\\n\\n   Supported range\\n     0 .. UINT_MAX\\n   Default\\n     40\\n\\nXML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_EXPANSIONS\\n   Limit the total length of all entity expansions throughout the entire\\n   document. The lengths of all entities are accumulated in a parser variable.\\n   The setting protects against quadratic blowup attacks (lots of expansions\\n   of a large entity declaration). When the sum of all entities exceeds\\n   the limit, the parser stops and fails with `XML_ERROR_ENTITY_EXPANSION`.\\n   A value of 0 disables the protection.\\n\\n   Supported range\\n     0 .. UINT_MAX\\n   Default\\n     8 MiB\\n\\nXML_FEATURE_RESET_DTD\\n   Reset all DTD information after the <!DOCTYPE> block has been parsed. When\\n   the flag is set (default: false) all DTD information after the\\n   endDoctypeDeclHandler has been called. The flag can be set inside the\\n   endDoctypeDeclHandler. Without DTD information any entity reference in\\n   the document body leads to `XML_ERROR_UNDEFINED_ENTITY`.\\n\\n   Supported range\\n     0, 1\\n   Default\\n     0\\n\\n\\nHow to avoid XML vulnerabilities\\n================================\\n\\nBest practices\\n--------------\\n\\n* Don't allow DTDs\\n* Don't expand entities\\n* Don't resolve externals\\n* Limit parse depth\\n* Limit total input size\\n* Limit parse time\\n* Favor a SAX or iterparse-like parser for potential large data\\n* Validate and properly quote arguments to XSL transformations and\\n  XPath queries\\n* Don't use XPath expression from untrusted sources\\n* Don't apply XSL transformations that come untrusted sources\\n\\n(based on Brad Hill's `Attacking XML Security`_)\\n\\n\\nOther things to consider\\n========================\\n\\nXML, XML parsers and processing libraries have more features and possible\\nissue that could lead to DoS vulnerabilities or security exploits in\\napplications. I have compiled an incomplete list of theoretical issues that\\nneed further research and more attention. The list is deliberately pessimistic\\nand a bit paranoid, too. It contains things that might go wrong under daffy\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n\\nattribute blowup / hash collision attack\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nXML parsers may use an algorithm with quadratic runtime O(n :sup:`2`) to\\nhandle attributes and namespaces. If it uses hash tables (dictionaries) to\\nstore attributes and namespaces the implementation may be vulnerable to\\nhash collision attacks, thus reducing the performance to O(n :sup:`2`) again.\\nIn either case an attacker is able to forge a denial of service attack with\\nan XML document that contains thousands upon thousands of attributes in\\na single node.\\n\\nI haven't researched yet if expat, pyexpat or libxml2 are vulnerable.\\n\\n\\ndecompression bomb\\n------------------\\n\\nThe issue of decompression bombs (aka `ZIP bomb`_) apply to all XML libraries\\nthat can parse compressed XML stream like gzipped HTTP streams or LZMA-ed\\nfiles. For an attacker it can reduce the amount of transmitted data by three\\nmagnitudes or more. Gzip is able to compress 1 GiB zeros to roughly 1 MB,\\nlzma is even better::\\n\\n    $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | gzip > zeros.gz\\n    $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | lzma -z > zeros.xy\\n    $ ls -sh zeros.*\\n    1020K zeros.gz\\n     148K zeros.xy\\n\\nNone of Python's standard XML libraries decompress streams except for\\n``xmlrpclib``. The module is vulnerable <https://bugs.python.org/issue16043>\\nto decompression bombs.\\n\\nlxml can load and process compressed data through libxml2 transparently.\\nlibxml2 can handle even very large blobs of compressed data efficiently\\nwithout using too much memory. But it doesn't protect applications from\\ndecompression bombs. A carefully written SAX or iterparse-like approach can\\nbe safe.\\n\\n\\nProcessing Instruction\\n----------------------\\n\\n`PI`_'s like::\\n\\n  <?xml-stylesheet type=\\\"text/xsl\\\" href=\\\"style.xsl\\\"?>\\n\\nmay impose more threats for XML processing. It depends if and how a\\nprocessor handles processing instructions. The issue of URL retrieval with\\nnetwork or local file access apply to processing instructions, too.\\n\\n\\nOther DTD features\\n------------------\\n\\n`DTD`_ has more features like ``<!NOTATION>``. I haven't researched how\\nthese features may be a security threat.\\n\\n\\nXPath\\n-----\\n\\nXPath statements may introduce DoS vulnerabilities. Code should never execute\\nqueries from untrusted sources. An attacker may also be able to create an XML\\ndocument that makes certain XPath queries costly or resource hungry.\\n\\n\\nXPath injection attacks\\n-----------------------\\n\\nXPath injeciton attacks pretty much work like SQL injection attacks.\\nArguments to XPath queries must be quoted and validated properly, especially\\nwhen they are taken from the user. The page `Avoid the dangers of XPath injection`_\\nlist some ramifications of XPath injections.\\n\\nPython's standard library doesn't have XPath support. Lxml supports\\nparameterized XPath queries which does proper quoting. You just have to use\\nits xpath() method correctly::\\n\\n   # DON'T\\n   >>> tree.xpath(\\\"/tag[@id='%s']\\\" % value)\\n\\n   # instead do\\n   >>> tree.xpath(\\\"/tag[@id=$tagid]\\\", tagid=name)\\n\\n\\nXInclude\\n--------\\n\\n`XML Inclusion`_ is another way to load and include external files::\\n\\n   <root xmlns:xi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\\\">\\n     <xi:include href=\\\"filename.txt\\\" parse=\\\"text\\\" />\\n   </root>\\n\\nThis feature should be disabled when XML files from an untrusted source are\\nprocessed. Some Python XML libraries and libxml2 support XInclude but don't\\nhave an option to sandbox inclusion and limit it to allowed directories.\\n\\n\\nXMLSchema location\\n------------------\\n\\nA validating XML parser may download schema files from the information in a\\n``xsi:schemaLocation`` attribute.\\n\\n::\\n\\n  <ead xmlns=\\\"urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9\\\"\\n       xmlns:xsi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\\"\\n       xsi:schemaLocation=\\\"urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9 http://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.xsd\\\">\\n  </ead>\\n\\n\\nXSL Transformation\\n------------------\\n\\nYou should keep in mind that XSLT is a Turing complete language. Never\\nprocess XSLT code from unknown or untrusted source! XSLT processors may\\nallow you to interact with external resources in ways you can't even imagine.\\nSome processors even support extensions that allow read/write access to file\\nsystem, access to JRE objects or scripting with Jython.\\n\\nExample from `Attacking XML Security`_ for Xalan-J::\\n\\n    <xsl:stylesheet version=\\\"1.0\\\"\\n     xmlns:xsl=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\\\"\\n     xmlns:rt=\\\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Runtime\\\"\\n     xmlns:ob=\\\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Object\\\"\\n     exclude-result-prefixes= \\\"rt ob\\\">\\n     <xsl:template match=\\\"/\\\">\\n       <xsl:variable name=\\\"runtimeObject\\\" select=\\\"rt:getRuntime()\\\"/>\\n       <xsl:variable name=\\\"command\\\"\\n         select=\\\"rt:exec($runtimeObject, &apos;c:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe&apos;)\\\"/>\\n       <xsl:variable name=\\\"commandAsString\\\" select=\\\"ob:toString($command)\\\"/>\\n       <xsl:value-of select=\\\"$commandAsString\\\"/>\\n     </xsl:template>\\n    </xsl:stylesheet>\\n\\n\\nRelated CVEs\\n============\\n\\nCVE-2013-1664\\n  Unrestricted entity expansion induces DoS vulnerabilities in Python XML\\n  libraries (XML bomb)\\n\\nCVE-2013-1665\\n  External entity expansion in Python XML libraries inflicts potential\\n  security flaws and DoS vulnerabilities\\n\\n\\nOther languages / frameworks\\n=============================\\n\\nSeveral other programming languages and frameworks are vulnerable as well. A\\ncouple of them are affected by the fact that libxml2 up to 2.9.0 has no\\nprotection against quadratic blowup attacks. Most of them have potential\\ndangerous default settings for entity expansion and external entities, too.\\n\\nPerl\\n----\\n\\nPerl's XML::Simple is vulnerable to quadratic entity expansion and external\\nentity expansion (both local and remote).\\n\\n\\nRuby\\n----\\n\\nRuby's REXML document parser is vulnerable to entity expansion attacks\\n(both quadratic and exponential) but it doesn't do external entity\\nexpansion by default. In order to counteract entity expansion you have to\\ndisable the feature::\\n\\n  REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 0\\n\\nlibxml-ruby and hpricot don't expand entities in their default configuration.\\n\\n\\nPHP\\n---\\n\\nPHP's SimpleXML API is vulnerable to quadratic entity expansion and loads\\nentities from local and remote resources. The option ``LIBXML_NONET`` disables\\nnetwork access but still allows local file access. ``LIBXML_NOENT`` seems to\\nhave no effect on entity expansion in PHP 5.4.6.\\n\\n\\nC# / .NET / Mono\\n----------------\\n\\nInformation in `XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN)`_ suggest that .NET is\\nvulnerable with its default settings. The article contains code snippets\\nhow to create a secure XML reader::\\n\\n  XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();\\n  settings.ProhibitDtd = false;\\n  settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;\\n  settings.XmlResolver = null;\\n  XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);\\n\\n\\nJava\\n----\\n\\nUntested.

If the [Open Force Field toolkit](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield) is installed, it will automatically detect and use this entry point:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from openforcefield.typing.engines.smirnoff import ForceField\\n>>> ff = ForceField('smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.9.offxml') \\n```\\n\\nOtherwise, the entry point can be accessed by querying the `openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory` entry point group.\\n\\n```\\n>>> from pkg_resources import iter_entry_points\\n>>> for entry_point in iter_entry_points(group='openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory'):\\n...     print(entry_point.load()())\\n```\\n\\n## What it is\\n\\nThe provided OFFXML (force field) files are successive versions of a general-purpose small molecule force field, written in [the SMIRNOFF format](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/blob/master/The-SMIRNOFF-force-field-format.md); this force field should cover all or almost all of drug-like chemical space, and illustrate some of the major functionality of the SMIRNOFF format as well as how it simplifies the specification of force field parameters in a compact and chemically sensible way.\\n\\nHOWEVER, this is not expected to be (at present) an especially accurate small molecule force field.\\nIts authors (see History, below) expect that while coverage will initially be good, additional refinements will be required (and possibly some expansion of the number of parameters) before it can rival current force fields such as GAFF or OPLS in accuracy.\\nHowever, we are optimistic that it already rivals them in extensibility, and potentially with relatively minimal work can be extended to be a compelling present-day small molecule force field.\\n\\nAs with typical members of the AMBER force field family, SMIRNOFF99Frosst is intended to be used with RESP or AM1-BCC charges which are not specified by the force field itself.\\n\\n**Differences from parm99 and parm@frosst**:\\n\\nSMIRNOFF99Frosst is neither parm99 nor parm@frosst exactly, for a number of reasons including that:\\n\\n- It covers, or should cover with only slight modification, all reasonable organic chemistry, which neither of the above did\\n- It is much simpler (because of parameter consolidation by SMIRKS, because of removing questionably differentiated parameters, and because its goal is to be a \\\"good starting point\\\" than a finished product)\\n- It introduces a number of approximations/consolidations for conciseness/clarity\\n- It fixes a number of mistakes/omissions, etc.\\n\\nThe second and third bullet points are particularly important.\\nWhen many parameters (such as torsional barrier heights, or equlibrium angles) for similar chemical functionality differed only slightly in the existing force fields, these were often deliberately consolidated to have a single value.\\n\\nThe last bullet point is also noteworthy.\\nBecause of limitations of atom typing, many torsions were missing in parm99/parm@frosst, resulting in generics being erroneously applied when a more specialized torsion could have served.\\nThe use of SMIRKS typically means that this is not the case, so many mistakes are eliminated.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThis forcefield, SMIRNOFF99Frosst, is a logical descendant of AMBER's parm99 forcefield as well as Merck-Frosst's [parm@frosst](http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/parm_at_Frosst/), but is generalized/simplified and put into the SMIRNOFF format.\\n\\nSMIRNOFF99Frosst was created by Christopher I. Bayly (with help from Caitlin C. Bannan and David L. Mobley, UC Irvine) during his sabbatical at UCI during Summer 2016.\\nIt was created by hand curation of the original parm99 and parm@frosst parameter and frcmod files (manually creating SMIRKS patterns, condensing parameters, etc.).\\nUsage of SMIRKS, along with application of Bayly's chemical intuition and extensive history with the AMBER force field family, allowed the number of parameter lines to be reduced from the multiple thousands of parm99+parm@frosst to the few hundred seen here.\\n\\n## Tentative plan\\n\\nWe expect to continue to manually expand this to cover more chemical space and, when needed, to introduce additional parameters to improve accuracy.\\nSubsequent versions are expected to build on Bayly's hand created version with some enhancements by Caitlin Bannan by improving specific parameters, further differentiating some chemical functionality, etc.\\nHowever, derivatives are expected to retain this basic structure and the AMBER legacy/history; a full refitting of bonded parameters would result in a separate force field rather than a new version of this force field.\\n\\nIn general, this repository will only contain force fields that aim to reproduce the behavior of parm99/parm@Frosst using the SMIRNOFF format. \\nOnce the Open Force Field Initiative begins parameter optimizations, the resulting force field should be migrated to separate base name.\\n\\n## General versioning guidelines\\n\\n_Applicable in general to SMIRNOFF-format FFs produced by the Open Force Field Consortium_\\n\\nForce fields moving forward will be called `name-X.Y.Z`\\n\\n* `X` denotes some major change in functional form.\\n* `Y` is the parameterization epoch / generation, or a minor change that can affect energy.\\n* `Z` is a bugfix version -- e.g. something we've caught and corrected.  \\n\\n## Using SMIRNOFF99Frosst\\n\\nIn OpenMM, application of SMIRNOFF99Frosst to small molecules should be straightforward via `openforcefield` with examples available in the [openforcefield repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/tree/master/examples).\\nAdditionally, with ParmEd, it should be possible to convert parameterized OpenMM systems into other formats such as AMBER, CHARMM, or GROMACS, making this forcefield available in a variety of packages.\\n\\n\\n## Versions\\n- Version 1.0/[Version 1.0.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154235) (equivalent): Initial release after hand curation by C. I. Bayly and C. C. Bannan. DOI [10.5281/zenodo.154235](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154235)\\n- [Version 1.0.2](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154555): Fixes an out-of-order generic (bond `[#6X2:1]-[#6:2]`) as per [Issue 4](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/4).\\n- [Version 1.0.3](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.161616): Bug fixes -- adding one omitted bond length, fixing four torsional smirks patterns, and adding one missing torsional term as detailed in [smarty issue 164](https://github.com/openforcefield/smarty/pull/164)\\n- [Version 1.0.4](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.348165): Bug fixes --  #11: Fix the parm@Frosst-derived C-OS bond length so it does not also match (and thus override) C-OH, switching from SMIRKS of `[#6X3:1](=[#8X1])-[#8X2:2]` to `[#6X3:1](=[#8X1])-[#8X2H0:2]`, which avoids overriding `[#6X3:1]-[#8X2H1:2]`. And then add back in a generic which should have been present ([PR 15](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/pull/15), fixing a bug introduced by [PR 11](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/pull/11))\\n- [Version 1.0.5](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.495249): Substantially improved coverage of chemical space via more general generics as well as a variety of new parameters introduced via generalization/estimation from other force fields such as GAFF/GAFF2. This release, this version covers an internal set of molecules from DrugBank filtered to remove metal atoms and to contain only compounds with less than 200 heavy atoms. Full documentation of changes is available [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/smarty/pull/232).\\n- [Version 1.0.6](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1093346): Added monovalent ion parameters (Joung/Cheatham) for TIP3P as default. Added angle parameters for cyclobutyl groups. Replaced `R` decorators with `x` to guarantee compatibility between OpenEye toolkits and RDKit SMIRKS parsing.\\n- [Version 1.0.7](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186466): Add hydroxyl hydrogen radii (as per SMIRNOFF initial paper); remove generics with pure wildcards (not even elemental types).\\n- [Version 1.0.8](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2565295): Fix human error in hydroxyl hydrogens; fix bond parameters between hydrogen and divalent carbons ([issue #81](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/81)); and fixed SMIRKS patterns for angle parameters around trivalent carbon in 5-membered rings ([issue #84](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/84)).\\n- [Version 1.0.9](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3256444): Addresses [issue 89](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/89): Fixes torsion t56, where SMIRKS `[!1:1]-[#7X4,#7X3:2]-[#6X4;r3:3]-[*:4]` should be `[!#1:1]-[#7X4,#7X3:2]-[#6X4;r3:3]-[*:4]`. The first means \\\"not an isotope with mass 1\\\" (`!1`), but we intend for it to apply to all hydrogens, so it has been changed to `!#1`.\\n- Version 1.1.0: Adds hydrogen bond constraints. Updates contents to SMIRNOFF 0.3 spec (spec change performed by OFF toolkit 0.4.0 reading smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.9, and then writing the `ForceField` object out in the 0.3 spec). Fixes several issues with FF hierarchy, SMIRKS patterns. This fixes some issues with coverage of certain areas of chemical space, and parameters which could never be utilized due to hierarchy issues.

Unlike shelve,\\nmany processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in \\ndatabase is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.\\n\\nConcurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence\\nthe \\\"database\\\" is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.\\n\\nExample usage::\\n    \\n    from pickleshare import *\\n    db = PickleShareDB('~/testpickleshare')\\n    db.clear()\\n    print(\\\"Should be empty:\\\",db.items())\\n    db['hello'] = 15\\n    db['aku ankka'] = [1,2,313]\\n    db['paths/are/ok/key'] = [1,(5,46)]\\n    print(db.keys())\\n\\nThis module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load\\n(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the \\nadvanced features of a \\\"real\\\" object database.\\n\\nInstallation guide: pip install pickleshare\\n\",\n",

sustainable!</strong>\\n</p>\\n\\n<!-- teaser-end -->\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n*attrs* gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:\\n\\n<!-- code-begin -->\\n\\n```pycon\\n>>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory\\n\\n>>> @define\\n... class SomeClass:\\n...     a_number: int = 42\\n...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)\\n...\\n...     def hard_math(self, another_number):\\n...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number\\n\\n\\n>>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\\n>>> sc\\nSomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])\\n\\n>>> sc.hard_math(3)\\n19\\n>>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\\nTrue\\n>>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])\\nTrue\\n\\n>>> asdict(sc)\\n{'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}\\n\\n>>> SomeClass()\\nSomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])\\n\\n>>> C = make_class(\\\"C\\\", [\\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\"])\\n>>> C(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"bar\\\")\\nC(a='foo', b='bar')\\n```\\n\\nAfter *declaring* your attributes, *attrs* gives you:\\n\\n- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,\\n- a nice human-readable `__repr__`,\\n- equality-checking methods,\\n- an initializer,\\n- and much more,\\n\\n*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.\\nThe classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.\\n\\nCheck out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for an in-depth explanation!\\n\\n\\n### Hate Type Annotations!?\\n\\nNo problem!\\nTypes are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.\\nSimply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom attrs import define, field\\n\\n@define\\nclass SomeClass:\\n    a_number = field(default=42)\\n    list_of_numbers = field(factory=list)\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Data Classes\\n\\nOn the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).\\nIn practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.\\nFor instance, it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization), has a replacement for `__init_subclass__`, and allows for stepping through the generated methods using a debugger.\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes), but generally speaking, we are more likely to commit crimes against nature to make things work that one would expect to work, but that are quite complicated in practice.\\n\\n\\n## Project Information\\n\\n-

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\\nits way towards this goal.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Main Features](#main-features)\\n- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\\n- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\\n- [License](#license)\\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\\n- [Background](#background)\\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\\n- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\\n- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\\n\\n## Main Features\\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\\n\\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\\n    objects\\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\\n    align the data for you in computations\\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\\n    and transforming data\\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\\n    into DataFrame objects\\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\\n    large data sets\\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\\n    sets\\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\\n    data sets\\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\\n    labels per tick)\\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\\n    date shifting and lagging\\n\\n\\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\\n\\n## Where to get it\\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\\n\\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\\n\\n```sh\\n# conda\\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas\\n```\\n\\n```sh\\n# or PyPI\\npip install pandas\\n```\\n\\nThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

      "            \"description\": \"# xmltodict\\n\\n`xmltodict` is a Python module that makes working with XML feel like you are working with [JSON](http://docs.python.org/library/json.html), as in this [\\\"spec\\\"](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/05/31/converting-between-xml-and-json.html):\\n\\n[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/martinblech/xmltodict.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/martinblech/xmltodict)\\n\\n```python\\n>>> print(json.dumps(xmltodict.parse(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n...  <mydocument has=\\\"an attribute\\\">\\n...    <and>\\n...      <many>elements</many>\\n...      <many>more elements</many>\\n...    </and>\\n...    <plus a=\\\"complex\\\">\\n...      element as well\\n...    </plus>\\n...  </mydocument>\\n...  \\\"\\\"\\\"), indent=4))\\n{\\n    \\\"mydocument\\\": {\\n        \\\"@has\\\": \\\"an attribute\\\", \\n        \\\"and\\\": {\\n            \\\"many\\\": [\\n                \\\"elements\\\", \\n                \\\"more elements\\\"\\n            ]\\n        }, \\n        \\\"plus\\\": {\\n            \\\"@a\\\": \\\"complex\\\", \\n            \\\"#text\\\": \\\"element as well\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Namespace support\\n\\nBy default, `xmltodict` does no XML namespace processing (it just treats namespace declarations as regular node attributes), but passing `process_namespaces=True` will make it expand namespaces for you:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> xml = \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n... <root xmlns=\\\"http://defaultns.com/\\\"\\n...       xmlns:a=\\\"http://a.com/\\\"\\n...       xmlns:b=\\\"http://b.com/\\\">\\n...   <x>1</x>\\n...   <a:y>2</a:y>\\n...   <b:z>3</b:z>\\n... </root>\\n... \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n>>> xmltodict.parse(xml, process_namespaces=True) == {\\n...     'http://defaultns.com/:root': {\\n...         'http://defaultns.com/:x': '1',\\n...         'http://a.com/:y': '2',\\n...         'http://b.com/:z': '3',\\n...     }\\n... }\\nTrue\\n```\\n\\nIt also lets you collapse certain namespaces to shorthand prefixes, or skip them altogether:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> namespaces = {\\n...     'http://defaultns.com/': None, # skip this namespace\\n...     'http://a.com/': 'ns_a', # collapse \\\"http://a.com/\\\" -> \\\"ns_a\\\"\\n... }\\n>>> xmltodict.parse(xml, process_namespaces=True, namespaces=namespaces) == {\\n...     'root': {\\n...         'x': '1',\\n...         'ns_a:y': '2',\\n...         'http://b.com/:z': '3',\\n...     },\\n... }\\nTrue\\n```\\n\\n## Streaming mode\\n\\n`xmltodict` is very fast ([Expat](http://docs.python.org/library/pyexpat.html)-based) and has a streaming mode with a small memory footprint, suitable for big XML dumps like [Discogs](http://discogs.com/data/) or [Wikipedia](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/):\\n\\n```python\\n>>> def handle_artist(_, artist):\\n...     print(artist['name'])\\n...     return True\\n>>> \\n>>> xmltodict.parse(GzipFile('discogs_artists.xml.gz'),\\n...     item_depth=2, item_callback=handle_artist)\\nA Perfect Circle\\nFantômas\\nKing Crimson\\nChris Potter\\n...\\n```\\n\\nIt can also be used from the command line to pipe objects to a script like this:\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys, marshal\\nwhile True:\\n    _, article = marshal.load(sys.stdin)\\n    print(article['title'])\\n```\\n\\n```sh\\n$ bunzip2 enwiki-pages-articles.xml.bz2 | xmltodict.py 2 | myscript.py\\nAccessibleComputing\\nAnarchism\\nAfghanistanHistory\\nAfghanistanGeography\\nAfghanistanPeople\\nAfghanistanCommunications\\nAutism\\n...\\n```\\n\\nOr just cache the dicts so you don't have to parse that big XML file again. You do this only once:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ bunzip2 enwiki-pages-articles.xml.bz2 | xmltodict.py 2 | gzip > enwiki.dicts.gz\\n```\\n\\nAnd you reuse the dicts with every script that needs them:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ gunzip enwiki.dicts.gz | script1.py\\n$ gunzip enwiki.dicts.gz | script2.py\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Roundtripping\\n\\nYou can also convert in the other direction, using the `unparse()` method:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> mydict = {\\n...     'response': {\\n...             'status': 'good',\\n...             'last_updated': '2014-02-16T23:10:12Z',\\n...     }\\n... }\\n>>> print(unparse(mydict, pretty=True))\\n<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<response>\\n\\t<status>good</status>\\n\\t<last_updated>2014-02-16T23:10:12Z</last_updated>\\n</response>\\n```\\n\\nText values for nodes can be specified with the `cdata_key` key in the python dict, while node properties can be specified with the `attr_prefix` prefixed to the key name in the python dict. The default value for `attr_prefix` is `@` and the default value for `cdata_key` is `#text`.\\n\\n```python\\n>>> import xmltodict\\n>>> \\n>>> mydict = {\\n...     'text': {\\n...         '@color':'red',\\n...         '@stroke':'2',\\n...         '#text':'This is a test'\\n...     }\\n... }\\n>>> print(xmltodict.unparse(mydict, pretty=True))\\n<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<text stroke=\\\"2\\\" color=\\\"red\\\">This is a test</text>\\n```\\n\\nLists that are specified under a key in a dictionary use the key as a tag for each item. But if a list does have a parent key, for example if a list exists inside another list, it does not have a tag to use and the items are converted to a string as shown in the example below.  To give tags to nested lists, use the `expand_iter` keyword argument to provide a tag as demonstrated below. Note that using `expand_iter` will break roundtripping.\\n\\n```python\\n>>> mydict = {\\n...     \\\"line\\\": {\\n...         \\\"points\\\": [\\n...             [1, 5],\\n...             [2, 6],\\n...         ]\\n...     }\\n... }\\n>>> print(xmltodict.unparse(mydict, pretty=True))\\n<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<line>\\n        <points>[1, 5]</points>\\n        <points>[2, 6]</points>\\n</line>\\n>>> print(xmltodict.unparse(mydict, pretty=True, expand_iter=\\\"coord\\\"))\\n<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<line>\\n        <points>\\n                <coord>1</coord>\\n                <coord>5</coord>\\n        </points>\\n        <points>\\n                <coord>2</coord>\\n                <coord>6</coord>\\n        </points>\\n</line>\\n```\\n\\n## Ok, how do I get it?\\n\\n### Using pypi\\n\\nYou just need to\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pip install xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### Using conda\\n\\nFor installing `xmltodict` using Anaconda/Miniconda (*conda*) from the \\n[conda-forge channel][#xmltodict-conda] all you need to do is:\\n\\n[#xmltodict-conda]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/xmltodict\\n\\n```sh\\n$ conda install -c conda-forge xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### RPM-based distro (Fedora, RHEL, …)\\n\\nThere is an [official Fedora package for xmltodict](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-xmltodict).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo yum install python-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### Arch Linux\\n\\nThere is an [official Arch Linux package for xmltodict](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-xmltodict/).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo pacman -S python-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### Debian-based distro (Debian, Ubuntu, …)\\n\\nThere is an [official Debian package for xmltodict](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-xmltodict).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sudo apt install python-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### FreeBSD\\n\\nThere is an [official FreeBSD port for xmltodict](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/devel/py-xmltodict/).\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pkg install py36-xmltodict\\n```\\n\\n### openSUSE/SLE (SLE 15, Leap 15, Tumbleweed)\\n\\nThere is an [official openSUSE package for xmltodict](https://software.opensuse.org/package/python-xmltodict).\\n\\n```sh\\n# Python2\\n$ zypper in python2-xmltodict\\n\\n# Python3\\n$ zypper in python3-xmltodict\\n```\\n\",\n",

That way your new feature will also be compatible with the new Notebook v7.\\n\\n## Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook\\n\\nJupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for\\nProject Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of\\nThe Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic\\nrelease containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _IPython notebook_,\\nand language specific code, such as the _IPython kernel for Python_. As\\ncomputing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the\\nlanguage-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the\\ncommunity develop language specific kernels which are found in their own\\ndiscrete repos.\\n\\n- [The Big Split™ announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7)\\n- [Jupyter Ascending blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-ascending-1bf5b362d97e)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can find the installation documentation for the\\n[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\\nThe documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found\\n[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nFor a local installation, make sure you have\\n[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install notebook\\n```\\n\\n## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook\\n\\n### Running in a local installation\\n\\nLaunch with:\\n\\n```bash\\njupyter notebook\\n```\\n\\n### Running in a remote installation\\n\\nYou need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely.

The pyparsing module provides a library of\\nclasses that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in\\nPython code.\\n\\n*[Since first writing this description of pyparsing in late 2003, this\\ntechnique for developing parsers has become more widespread, under the\\nname Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more information on PEGs*\\n`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>`__\\n*.]*\\n\\nHere is a program to parse ``\\\"Hello, World!\\\"`` (or any greeting of the form\\n``\\\"salutation, addressee!\\\"``):\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from pyparsing import Word, alphas\\n    greet = Word(alphas) + \\\",\\\" + Word(alphas) + \\\"!\\\"\\n    hello = \\\"Hello, World!\\\"\\n    print(hello, \\\"->\\\", greet.parse_string(hello))\\n\\nThe program outputs the following::\\n\\n    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']\\n\\nThe Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the\\nself-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operator\\ndefinitions.\\n\\nThe parsed results returned from ``parse_string()`` is a collection of type\\n``ParseResults``, which can be accessed as a\\nnested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.\\n\\nThe pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically\\nvexing when writing text parsers:\\n\\n- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle ``\\\"Hello,World!\\\"``, ``\\\"Hello , World !\\\"``, etc.)\\n- quoted strings\\n- embedded comments\\n\\nThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple CORBA IDL\\nparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-\\nfunction algebraic notation parser, among many others.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n=============\\n\\nThere are many examples in the online docstrings of the classes\\nand methods in pyparsing. You can find them compiled into `online docs <https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. Additional\\ndocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online\\n`GitHub wiki <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki>`__.

If you want to\\nlearn about using ØMQ in general, the excellent [ØMQ\\nGuide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/py:all) is the place to start, which has a\\nPython version of every example. We also have some information on our\\n[wiki](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/wiki).\\n\\n## Downloading\\n\\nUnless you specifically want to develop PyZMQ, we recommend downloading\\nthe PyZMQ source code or wheels from\\n[PyPI](https://pypi.io/project/pyzmq/),\\nor install with conda.\\n\\nYou can also get the latest source code from our GitHub repository, but\\nbuilding from the repository will require that you install recent Cython.\\n\\n## Building and installation\\n\\nFor more detail on building pyzmq, see [our docs](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/build.html).\\n\\nWe build wheels for macOS, Windows, and Linux, so you can get a binary on those platforms with:\\n\\n```\\npip install pyzmq\\n```\\n\\nbut compiling from source with `pip install pyzmq` should work in most environments.\\nMake sure you are using the latest pip, or it may not find the right wheels.\\n\\nIf the wheel doesn't work for some reason, or you want to force pyzmq to be compiled\\n(this is often preferable if you already have libzmq installed and configured the way you want it),\\nyou can force installation from source with:\\n\\n```\\npip install --no-binary=pyzmq pyzmq\\n```\\n\\n## Old versions\\n\\npyzmq 16 drops support Python 2.6 and 3.2.\\nIf you need to use one of those Python versions, you can pin your pyzmq version to before 16:\\n\\n```\\npip install 'pyzmq<16'\\n```\\n\\nFor libzmq 2.0.x, use 'pyzmq\\\\<2.1'\\n\\npyzmq-2.1.11 was the last version of pyzmq to support Python 2.5,\\nand pyzmq ≥ 2.2.0 requires Python ≥ 2.6.\\npyzmq-13.0.0 introduces PyPy support via CFFI, which only supports libzmq-3.2.2 and newer.\\n\\nPyZMQ releases ≤ 2.2.0 matched libzmq versioning, but this is no longer the case,\\nstarting with PyZMQ 13.0.0 (it was the thirteenth release, so why not?).\\nPyZMQ ≥ 13.0 follows semantic versioning conventions accounting only for PyZMQ itself.\\n\",\n",

Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto\\nfunctionality. Other features include refactoring, code search and finding\\nreferences.\\n\\nJedi has a simple API to work with. There is a reference implementation as a\\n`VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_. Autocompletion in your\\nREPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively and for the CPython REPL you\\ncan install it. Jedi is well tested and bugs should be rare.\\n\\nJedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:\\n\\n- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)\\n- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_)\\n- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)\\n- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])\\n- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)\\n- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though.  [`see\\n  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]\\n- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)\\n- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)\\n- Gedit (gedi_)\\n- wdb_ - Web Debugger\\n- `Eric IDE`_\\n- `IPython 6.0.0+ <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_\\n- `xonsh shell <https://xon.sh/contents.html>`_ has `jedi extension <https://xon.sh/xontribs.html#jedi>`_\\n\\nand many more!\\n\\nThere are a few language servers that use Jedi:\\n\\n- `jedi-language-server <https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server>`_\\n- `python-language-server <https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server>`_ (currently unmaintained)\\n- `python-lsp-server <https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server>`_ (fork from python-language-server)\\n- `anakin-language-server <https://github.com/muffinmad/anakin-language-server>`_\\n\\nHere are some pictures taken from jedi-vim_:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_complete.png\\n\\nCompletion for almost anything:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_function.png\\n\\nDocumentation:\\n\\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_pydoc.png\\n\\n\\nGet the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_\\n(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).\\n\\nDocs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with enhancements\\nand/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic versioning\\n<https://semver.org/>`_.\\n\\nIf you want to stay **up-to-date** with releases, please **subscribe** to this\\nmailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/jedi-announce. To subscribe you can\\nsimply send an empty email to ``jedi-announce+subscribe@googlegroups.com``.\\n\\nIssues & Questions\\n==================\\n\\nYou can file issues and questions in the `issue tracker\\n<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/>`. Alternatively you can also ask on\\n`Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-jedi>`_ with\\nthe label ``python-jedi``.\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n`Check out the docs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.\\n\\nFeatures and Limitations\\n========================\\n\\nJedi's features are listed here:\\n`Features <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_.\\n\\nYou can run Jedi on Python 3.6+ but it should also\\nunderstand code that is older than those versions. Additionally you should be\\nable to use `Virtualenvs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html#environments>`_\\nvery well.\\n\\nTips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes>`_.\\n\\nAPI\\n---\\n\\nYou can find a comprehensive documentation for the\\n`API here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html>`_.\\n\\nAutocompletion / Goto / Documentation\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are the following commands:\\n\\n- ``jedi.Script.goto``\\n- ``jedi.Script.infer``\\n- ``jedi.Script.help``\\n- ``jedi.Script.complete``\\n- ``jedi.Script.get_references``\\n- ``jedi.Script.get_signatures``\\n- ``jedi.Script.get_context``\\n\\nThe returned objects are very powerful and are really all you might need.\\n\\nAutocompletion in your REPL (IPython, etc.)\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nJedi is a dependency of IPython. Autocompletion in IPython with Jedi is\\ntherefore possible without additional configuration.\\n\\nHere is an `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_ how REPL completion\\ncan look like.\\nFor the ``python`` shell you can enable tab completion in a `REPL\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.\\n\\nStatic Analysis\\n---------------\\n\\nFor a lot of forms of static analysis, you can try to use\\n``jedi.Script(...).get_names``. It will return a list of names that you can\\nthen filter and work with. There is also a way to list the syntax errors in a\\nfile: ``jedi.Script.get_syntax_errors``.\\n\\n\\nRefactoring\\n-----------\\n\\nJedi supports the following refactorings:\\n\\n- ``jedi.Script.inline``\\n- ``jedi.Script.rename``\\n- ``jedi.Script.extract_function``\\n- ``jedi.Script.extract_variable``\\n\\nCode Search\\n-----------\\n\\nThere is support for module search with ``jedi.Script.search``, and project\\nsearch for ``jedi.Project.search``. The way to search is either by providing a\\nname like ``foo`` or by using dotted syntax like ``foo.bar``. Additionally you\\ncan provide the API type like ``class foo.bar.Bar``. There are also the\\nfunctions ``jedi.Script.complete_search`` and ``jedi.Project.complete_search``.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n===========\\n\\nThere's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.\\n\\nTesting\\n=======\\n\\nThe test suite uses ``pytest``::\\n\\n    pip install pytest\\n\\nIf you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 3.8), it is as\\neasy as::\\n\\n    python3.8 -m pytest\\n\\nFor more detailed information visit the `testing documentation\\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/testing.html>`_.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n================\\n\\nThanks a lot to all the\\n`contributors <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/acknowledgements.html>`_!\\n\\n\\n.. _jedi-vim: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim\\n.. _youcompleteme: https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe\\n.. _deoplete-jedi: https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi\\n.. _completor.vim: https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim\\n.. _Jedi.el: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi\\n.. _company-mode: https://github.com/syohex/emacs-company-jedi\\n.. _elpy: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy\\n.. _anaconda-mode: https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode\\n.. _ycmd: https://github.com/abingham/emacs-ycmd\\n.. _sublimejedi: https://github.com/srusskih/SublimeJEDI\\n.. _anaconda: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda\\n.. _wdb: https://github.com/Kozea/wdb\\n.. _TextMate: https://github.com/lawrenceakka/python-jedi.tmbundle\\n.. _Kate: https://kate-editor.org\\n.. _Atom: https://atom.io/\\n.. _autocomplete-python-jedi: https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python-jedi\\n.. _GNOME Builder: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder\\n.. _Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/\\n.. _gedi: https://github.com/isamert/gedi\\n.. _Eric IDE: https://eric-ide.python-projects.org\\n\\n\\n.. :changelog:\\n\\nChangelog\\n---------\\n\\nUnreleased\\n++++++++++\\n\\n0.19.2 (2024-11-10)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python 3.13 support\\n\\n0.19.1 (2023-10-02)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python 3.12 support (Thanks Peter!)\\n\\n0.19.0 (2023-07-29)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python 3.11 support\\n- Massive improvements in performance for ``Interpreter`` (e.g. IPython) users.\\n  This especially affects ``pandas`` users with large datasets.\\n- Add ``jedi.settings.allow_unsafe_interpreter_executions`` to make it easier\\n  for IPython users to avoid unsafe executions.\\n\\n0.18.2 (2022-11-21)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added dataclass-equivalent for attrs.define\\n- Find fixtures from Pytest entrypoints; Examples of pytest plugins installed\\n  like this are pytest-django, pytest-sugar and Faker.\\n- Fixed Project.search, when a venv was involved, which is why for example\\n  `:Pyimport django.db` did not work in some cases in jedi-vim.\\n- And many smaller bugfixes\\n\\n0.18.1 (2021-11-17)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Implict namespaces are now a separate types in ``Name().type``\\n- Python 3.10 support\\n- Mostly bugfixes\\n\\n0.18.0 (2020-12-25)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Dropped Python 2 and Python 3.5\\n- Using ``pathlib.Path()`` as an output instead of ``str`` in most places:\\n  - ``Project.path``\\n  - ``Script.path``\\n  - ``Definition.module_path``\\n  - ``Refactoring.get_renames``\\n  - ``Refactoring.get_changed_files``\\n- Functions with ``@property`` now return ``property`` instead of ``function``\\n  in ``Name().type``\\n- Started using annotations\\n- Better support for the walrus operator\\n- Project attributes are now read accessible\\n- Removed all deprecations\\n\\nThis is likely going to be the last minor release before 1.0.\\n\\n0.17.2 (2020-07-17)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added an option to pass environment variables to ``Environment``\\n- ``Project(...).path`` exists now\\n- Support for Python 3.9\\n- A few bugfixes\\n\\nThis will be the last release that supports Python 2 and Python 3.5.\\n``0.18.0`` will be Python 3.6+.\\n\\n0.17.1 (2020-06-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Django ``Model`` meta class support\\n- Django Manager support (completion on Managers/QuerySets)\\n- Added Django Stubs to Jedi, thanks to all contributors of the\\n  `Django Stubs <https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs>`_ project\\n- Added ``SyntaxError.get_message``\\n- Python 3.9 support\\n- Bugfixes (mostly towards Generics)\\n\\n0.17.0 (2020-04-14)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added ``Project`` support. This allows a user to specify which folders Jedi\\n  should work with.\\n- Added support for Refactoring. The following refactorings have been\\n  implemented: ``Script.rename``, ``Script.inline``,\\n  ``Script.extract_variable`` and ``Script.extract_function``.\\n- Added ``Script.get_syntax_errors`` to display syntax errors in the current\\n  script.\\n- Added code search capabilities both for individual files and projects. The\\n  new functions are ``Project.search``, ``Project.complete_search``,\\n  ``Script.search`` and ``Script.complete_search``.\\n- Added ``Script.help`` to make it easier to display a help window to people.\\n  Now returns pydoc information as well for Python keywords/operators.  This\\n  means that on the class keyword it will now return the docstring of Python's\\n  builtin function ``help('class')``.\\n- The API documentation is now way more readable and complete. Check it out\\n  under https://jedi.readthedocs.io. A lot of it has been rewritten.\\n- Removed Python 3.4 support\\n- Many bugfixes\\n\\nThis is likely going to be the last minor version that supports Python 2 and\\nPython3.5. Bugfixes will be provided in 0.17.1+. The next minor/major version\\nwill probably be Jedi 1.0.0.\\n\\n0.16.0 (2020-01-26)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- **Added** ``Script.get_context`` to get information where you currently are.\\n- Completions/type inference of **Pytest fixtures**.\\n- Tensorflow, Numpy and Pandas completions should now be about **4-10x faster**\\n  after the first time they are used.\\n- Dict key completions are working now. e.g. ``d = {1000: 3}; d[10`` will\\n  expand to ``1000``.\\n- Completion for \\\"proxies\\\" works now. These are classes that have a\\n  ``__getattr__(self, name)`` method that does a ``return getattr(x, name)``.\\n  after loading them initially.\\n- Goto on a function/attribute in a class now goes to the definition in its\\n  super class.\\n- Big **Script API Changes**:\\n    - The line and column parameters of ``jedi.Script`` are now deprecated\\n    - ``completions`` deprecated, use ``complete`` instead\\n    - ``goto_assignments`` deprecated, use ``goto`` instead\\n    - ``goto_definitions`` deprecated, use ``infer`` instead\\n    - ``call_signatures`` deprecated, use ``get_signatures`` instead\\n    - ``usages`` deprecated, use ``get_references`` instead\\n    - ``jedi.names`` deprecated, use ``jedi.Script(...).get_names()``\\n- ``BaseName.goto_assignments`` renamed to ``BaseName.goto``\\n- Add follow_imports to ``Name.goto``. Now its signature matches\\n  ``Script.goto``.\\n- **Python 2 support deprecated**. For this release it is best effort. Python 2\\n  has reached the end of its life and now it's just about a smooth transition.\\n  Bugs for Python 2 will not be fixed anymore and a third of the tests are\\n  already skipped.\\n- Removed ``settings.no_completion_duplicates``. It wasn't tested and nobody\\n  was probably using it anyway.\\n- Removed ``settings.use_filesystem_cache`` and\\n  ``settings.additional_dynamic_modules``, they have no usage anymore. Pretty\\n  much nobody was probably using them.\\n\\n0.15.2 (2019-12-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Signatures are now detected a lot better\\n- Add fuzzy completions with ``Script(...).completions(fuzzy=True)``\\n- Files bigger than one MB (about 20kLOC) get cropped to avoid getting\\n  stuck completely.\\n- Many small Bugfixes\\n- A big refactoring around contexts/values\\n\\n0.15.1 (2019-08-13)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Small bugfix and removal of a print statement\\n\\n0.15.0 (2019-08-11)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added file path completions, there's a **new** ``Completion.type`` now:\\n  ``path``. Example: ``'/ho`` -> ``'/home/``\\n- ``*args``/``**kwargs`` resolving. If possible Jedi replaces the parameters\\n  with the actual alternatives.\\n- Better support for enums/dataclasses\\n- When using Interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot of people\\n  have complained about this. Discussion in #1299, #1347.\\n\\nNew APIs:\\n\\n- ``Name.get_signatures() -> List[Signature]``. Signatures are similar to\\n  ``CallSignature``. ``Name.params`` is therefore deprecated.\\n- ``Signature.to_string()`` to format signatures.\\n- ``Signature.params -> List[ParamName]``, ParamName has the\\n  following additional attributes ``infer_default()``, ``infer_annotation()``,\\n  ``to_string()``, and ``kind``.\\n- ``Name.execute() -> List[Name]``, makes it possible to infer\\n  return values of functions.\\n\\n\\n0.14.1 (2019-07-13)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- CallSignature.index should now be working a lot better\\n- A couple of smaller bugfixes\\n\\n0.14.0 (2019-06-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Added ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)`` as well as ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)``\\n- Stubs are used now for type inference\\n- Typeshed is used for better type inference\\n- Reworked Name.full_name, should have more correct return values\\n\\n0.13.3 (2019-02-24)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed an issue with embedded Python, see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870\\n\\n0.13.2 (2018-12-15)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed a bug that led to Jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.\\n\\n0.13.1 (2018-10-02)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.\\n\\n0.13.0 (2018-10-02)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- A small release. Some bug fixes.\\n- Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python\\n  foundation.\\n- Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python\\n  process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.\\n- Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.\\n- ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that\\n  changes the previous behavior slightly.\\n\\n0.12.1 (2018-06-30)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing will work\\n  anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug fixes. Unfortunately Jedi\\n  still uses a few internals of parso that make it hard to keep compatibility\\n  over multiple releases. Parso >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.\\n\\n0.12.0 (2018-04-15)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Virtualenv/Environment support\\n- F-String Completion/Goto Support\\n- Cannot crash with segfaults anymore\\n- Cleaned up import logic\\n- Understand async/await and autocomplete it (including async generators)\\n- Better namespace completions\\n- Passing tests for Windows (including CI for Windows)\\n- Remove Python 2.6 support\\n\\n0.11.1 (2017-12-14)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Parso update - the caching layer was broken\\n- Better usages - a lot of internal code was ripped out and improved.\\n\\n0.11.0 (2017-09-20)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Split Jedi's parser into a separate project called ``parso``.\\n- Avoiding side effects in REPL completion.\\n- Numpy docstring support should be much better.\\n- Moved the `settings.*recursion*` away, they are no longer usable.\\n\\n0.10.2 (2017-04-05)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Python Packaging sucks. Some files were not included in 0.10.1.\\n\\n0.10.1 (2017-04-05)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Fixed a few very annoying bugs.\\n- Prepared the parser to be factored out of Jedi.\\n\\n0.10.0 (2017-02-03)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Actual semantic completions for the complete Python syntax.\\n- Basic type inference for ``yield from`` PEP 380.\\n- PEP 484 support (most of the important features of it). Thanks Claude! (@reinhrst)\\n- Added ``get_line_code`` to ``Name`` and ``Completion`` objects.\\n- Completely rewritten the type inference engine.\\n- A new and better parser for (fast) parsing diffs of Python code.\\n\\n0.9.0 (2015-04-10)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's. There is now\\n  an ``InferState.modules`` import cache, which resembles ``sys.modules``.\\n- Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring possible. It will\\n  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an AST would give)\\n  in the future.\\n- With the new parser, the type inference also completely changed. It's now\\n  simpler and more readable.\\n- Completely rewritten REPL completion.\\n- Added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to that\\n  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!\\n- Alpha version of the linter.\\n\\n\\n0.8.1 (2014-07-23)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve\\n  autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.\\n\\n0.8.0 (2014-05-05)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced\\n  drastically. Loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an\\n  import).\\n- REPL completion is starting to become usable.\\n- Various small API changes. Generally this release focuses on stability and\\n  refactoring of internal APIs.\\n- Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct Array\\n  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.\\n\\n0.7.0 (2013-08-09)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Switched from LGPL to MIT license.\\n- Added an Interpreter class to the API to make autocompletion in REPL\\n  possible.\\n- Added autocompletion support for namespace packages.\\n- Add sith.py, a new random testing method.\\n\\n0.6.0 (2013-05-14)\\n++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Much faster parser with builtin part caching.\\n- A test suite, thanks @tkf.\\n\\n0.5 versions (2012)\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Initial development.\\n\",\n",

This function returns a context manager\\nthat calls the given handler for any exceptions matching the sole argument.\\n\\nThe argument to ``catch()`` must be a dict (or any ``Mapping``) where each key is either\\nan exception class or an iterable of exception classes. Each value must be a callable\\nthat takes a single positional argument. The handler will be called at most once, with\\nan exception group as an argument which will contain all the exceptions that are any\\nof the given types, or their subclasses. The exception group may contain nested groups\\ncontaining more matching exceptions.\\n\\nThus, the following Python 3.11+ code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    try:\\n        ...\\n    except* (ValueError, KeyError) as excgroup:\\n        for exc in excgroup.exceptions:\\n            print('Caught exception:', type(exc))\\n    except* RuntimeError:\\n        print('Caught runtime error')\\n\\nwould be written with this backport like this:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from exceptiongroup import BaseExceptionGroup, catch\\n\\n    def value_key_err_handler(excgroup: BaseExceptionGroup) -> None:\\n        for exc in excgroup.exceptions:\\n            print('Caught exception:', type(exc))\\n\\n    def runtime_err_handler(exc: BaseExceptionGroup) -> None:\\n        print('Caught runtime error')\\n\\n    with catch({\\n        (ValueError, KeyError): value_key_err_handler,\\n        RuntimeError: runtime_err_handler\\n    }):\\n        ...\\n\\n**NOTE**: Just like with ``except*``, you cannot handle ``BaseExceptionGroup`` or\\n``ExceptionGroup`` with ``catch()``.\\n\\nSuppressing exceptions\\n======================\\n\\nThis library contains a backport of the ``contextlib.suppress()`` context manager from\\nPython 3.12.1. It allows you to selectively ignore certain exceptions, even when they're\\ninside exception groups:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from exceptiongroup import suppress\\n\\n    with suppress(RuntimeError):\\n        raise ExceptionGroup(\\\"\\\", [RuntimeError(\\\"boo\\\")])\\n\\nNotes on monkey patching\\n========================\\n\\nTo make exception groups render properly when an unhandled exception group is being\\nprinted out, this package does two things when it is imported on any Python version\\nearlier than 3.11:\\n\\n#. The  ``traceback.TracebackException`` class is monkey patched to store extra\\n   information about exception groups (in ``__init__()``) and properly format them (in\\n   ``format()``)\\n#. An exception hook is installed at ``sys.excepthook``, provided that no other hook is\\n   already present. This hook causes the exception to be formatted using\\n   ``traceback.TracebackException`` rather than the built-in rendered.\\n\\nIf ``sys.exceptionhook`` is found to be set to something else than the default when\\n``exceptiongroup`` is imported, no monkeypatching is done at all.\\n\\nTo prevent the exception hook and patches from being installed, set the environment\\nvariable ``EXCEPTIONGROUP_NO_PATCH`` to ``1``.\\n\\nFormatting exception groups\\n---------------------------\\n\\nNormally, the monkey patching applied by this library on import will cause exception\\ngroups to be printed properly in tracebacks. But in cases when the monkey patching is\\nblocked by a third party exception hook, or monkey patching is explicitly disabled,\\nyou can still manually format exceptions using the special versions of the ``traceback``\\nfunctions, like ``format_exception()``, listed at the top of this page. They work just\\nlike their counterparts in the ``traceback`` module, except that they use a separately\\npatched subclass of ``TracebackException`` to perform the rendering.\\n\\nParticularly in cases where a library installs its own exception hook, it is recommended\\nto use these special versions to do the actual formatting of exceptions/tracebacks.\\n\\n.. _PEP 654: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/\\n\\n\",\n",

It includes modules for statistics, optimization,\\nintegration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing,\\nODE solvers, and more.\\n\\n- **Website:** https://scipy.org\\n- **Documentation:** https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/\\n- **Development version of the documentation:** https://scipy.github.io/devdocs\\n- **SciPy development forum:** https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/scipy\\n- **Stack Overflow:** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy\\n- **Source code:** https://github.com/scipy/scipy\\n- **Contributing:** https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/index.html\\n- **Bug reports:** https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues\\n- **Code of Conduct:** https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html\\n- **Report a security vulnerability:** https://tidelift.com/docs/security\\n- **Citing in your work:** https://www.scipy.org/citing-scipy/\\n\\nSciPy is built to work with\\nNumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines,\\nsuch as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they\\nrun on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of\\ncharge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended\\nupon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need to\\nmanipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give\\nSciPy a try!\\n\\nFor the installation instructions, see `our install\\nguide <https://scipy.org/install/>`__.\\n\\n\\nCall for Contributions\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe appreciate and welcome contributions.

Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\\n\\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can.\\n\\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\\n\\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair Unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\\n\\n## 🍰 How\\n\\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\\n\\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\\n\\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess (aka. defining noise in rendered text).\\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\\n improve or rewrite it.\\n\\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\\n\\n## ⚡ Known limitations\\n\\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\\n\\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\\n\\n**If you are running:**\\n\\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\\n\\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\\n\\n## 👤 Contributing\\n\\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\\n\\n## 📝 License\\n\\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\\n\\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\\n\\n## 💼 For Enterprise\\n\\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\\nSubscription][1].

Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\\n\\n`typing_extensions` uses\\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The\\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\\nTherefore, it's safe to depend\\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,\\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\\n\\n## Included items\\n\\nSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\\ncomplete listing of module contents.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\\n\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"PySocks\\n=======\\n\\nPySocks lets you send traffic through SOCKS and HTTP proxy servers. It is a modern fork of [SocksiPy](http://socksipy.sourceforge.net/) with bug fixes and extra features.\\n\\nActs as a drop-in replacement to the socket module. Seamlessly configure SOCKS proxies for any socket object by calling `socket_object.set_proxy()`.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nFeatures\\n========\\n\\n* SOCKS proxy client for Python 2.7 and 3.4+\\n* TCP supported\\n* UDP mostly supported (issues may occur in some edge cases)\\n* HTTP proxy client included but not supported or recommended (you should use urllib2's or requests' own HTTP proxy interface)\\n* urllib2 handler included. `pip install` / `setup.py install` will automatically install the `sockshandler` module.\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n    pip install PySocks\\n\\nOr download the tarball / `git clone` and...\\n\\n    python setup.py install\\n\\nThese will install both the `socks` and `sockshandler` modules.\\n\\nAlternatively, include just `socks.py` in your project.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n*Warning:* PySocks/SocksiPy only supports HTTP proxies that use CONNECT tunneling. Certain HTTP proxies may not work with this library. If you wish to use HTTP (not SOCKS) proxies, it is recommended that you rely on your HTTP client's native proxy support (`proxies` dict for `requests`, or `urllib2.ProxyHandler` for `urllib2`) instead.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsage\\n=====\\n\\n## socks.socksocket ##\\n\\n    import socks\\n\\n    s = socks.socksocket() # Same API as socket.socket in the standard lib\\n\\n    s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"localhost\\\") # SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 use port 1080 by default\\n    # Or\\n    s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS4, \\\"localhost\\\", 4444)\\n    # Or\\n    s.set_proxy(socks.HTTP, \\\"5.5.5.5\\\", 8888)\\n\\n    # Can be treated identical to a regular socket object\\n    s.connect((\\\"www.somesite.com\\\", 80))\\n    s.sendall(\\\"GET / HTTP/1.1 ...\\\")\\n    print s.recv(4096)\\n\\n## Monkeypatching ##\\n\\nTo monkeypatch the entire standard library with a single default proxy:\\n\\n    import urllib2\\n    import socket\\n    import socks\\n\\n    socks.set_default_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"localhost\\\")\\n    socket.socket = socks.socksocket\\n\\n    urllib2.urlopen(\\\"http://www.somesite.com/\\\") # All requests will pass through the SOCKS proxy\\n\\nNote that monkeypatching may not work for all standard modules or for all third party modules, and generally isn't recommended. Monkeypatching is usually an anti-pattern in Python.\\n\\n## urllib2 Handler ##\\n\\nExample use case with the `sockshandler` urllib2 handler. Note that you must import both `socks` and `sockshandler`, as the handler is its own module separate from PySocks. The module is included in the PyPI package.\\n\\n    import urllib2\\n    import socks\\n    from sockshandler import SocksiPyHandler\\n\\n    opener = urllib2.build_opener(SocksiPyHandler(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"127.0.0.1\\\", 9050))\\n    print opener.open(\\\"http://www.somesite.com/\\\") # All requests made by the opener will pass through the SOCKS proxy\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nOriginal SocksiPy README attached below, amended to reflect API changes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nSocksiPy\\n\\nA Python SOCKS module.\\n\\n(C) 2006 Dan-Haim. All rights reserved.\\n\\nSee LICENSE file for details.\\n\\n\\n*WHAT IS A SOCKS PROXY?*\\n\\nA SOCKS proxy is a proxy server at the TCP level. In other words, it acts as\\na tunnel, relaying all traffic going through it without modifying it.\\nSOCKS proxies can be used to relay traffic using any network protocol that\\nuses TCP.\\n\\n*WHAT IS SOCKSIPY?*\\n\\nThis Python module allows you to create TCP connections through a SOCKS\\nproxy without any special effort.\\nIt also supports relaying UDP packets with a SOCKS5 proxy.\\n\\n*PROXY COMPATIBILITY*\\n\\nSocksiPy is compatible with three different types of proxies:\\n\\n1. SOCKS Version 4 (SOCKS4), including the SOCKS4a extension.\\n2. SOCKS Version 5 (SOCKS5).\\n3. HTTP Proxies which support tunneling using the CONNECT method.\\n\\n*SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS*\\n\\nBeing written in Python, SocksiPy can run on any platform that has a Python\\ninterpreter and TCP/IP support.\\nThis module has been tested with Python 2.3 and should work with greater versions\\njust as well.\\n\\n\\nINSTALLATION\\n-------------\\n\\nSimply copy the file \\\"socks.py\\\" to your Python's `lib/site-packages` directory,\\nand you're ready to go. [Editor's note: it is better to use `python setup.py install` for PySocks]\\n\\n\\nUSAGE\\n------\\n\\nFirst load the socks module with the command:\\n\\n    >>> import socks\\n    >>>\\n\\nThe socks module provides a class called `socksocket`, which is the base to all of the module's functionality.\\n\\nThe `socksocket` object has the same initialization parameters as the normal socket\\nobject to ensure maximal compatibility, however it should be noted that `socksocket` will only function with family being `AF_INET` and\\ntype being either `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`.\\nGenerally, it is best to initialize the `socksocket` object with no parameters\\n\\n    >>> s = socks.socksocket()\\n    >>>\\n\\nThe `socksocket` object has an interface which is very similiar to socket's (in fact\\nthe `socksocket` class is derived from socket) with a few extra methods.\\nTo select the proxy server you would like to use, use the `set_proxy` method, whose\\nsyntax is:\\n\\n    set_proxy(proxy_type, addr[, port[, rdns[, username[, password]]]])\\n\\nExplanation of the parameters:\\n\\n`proxy_type` - The type of the proxy server. This can be one of three possible\\nchoices: `PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS4`, `PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5` and `PROXY_TYPE_HTTP` for SOCKS4,\\nSOCKS5 and HTTP servers respectively. `SOCKS4`, `SOCKS5`, and `HTTP` are all aliases, respectively.\\n\\n`addr` - The IP address or DNS name of the proxy server.\\n\\n`port` - The port of the proxy server. Defaults to 1080 for socks and 8080 for http.\\n\\n`rdns` - This is a boolean flag than modifies the behavior regarding DNS resolving.\\nIf it is set to True, DNS resolving will be preformed remotely, on the server.\\nIf it is set to False, DNS resolving will be preformed locally. Please note that\\nsetting this to True with SOCKS4 servers actually use an extension to the protocol,\\ncalled SOCKS4a, which may not be supported on all servers (SOCKS5 and http servers\\nalways support DNS). The default is True.\\n\\n`username` - For SOCKS5 servers, this allows simple username / password authentication\\nwith the server. For SOCKS4 servers, this parameter will be sent as the userid.\\nThis parameter is ignored if an HTTP server is being used. If it is not provided,\\nauthentication will not be used (servers may accept unauthenticated requests).\\n\\n`password` - This parameter is valid only for SOCKS5 servers and specifies the\\nrespective password for the username provided.\\n\\nExample of usage:\\n\\n    >>> s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"socks.example.com\\\") # uses default port 1080\\n    >>> s.set_proxy(socks.SOCKS4, \\\"socks.test.com\\\", 1081)\\n\\nAfter the set_proxy method has been called, simply call the connect method with the\\ntraditional parameters to establish a connection through the proxy:\\n\\n    >>> s.connect((\\\"www.sourceforge.net\\\", 80))\\n    >>>\\n\\nConnection will take a bit longer to allow negotiation with the proxy server.\\nPlease note that calling connect without calling `set_proxy` earlier will connect\\nwithout a proxy (just like a regular socket).\\n\\nErrors: Any errors in the connection process will trigger exceptions. The exception\\nmay either be generated by the underlying socket layer or may be custom module\\nexceptions, whose details follow:\\n\\nclass `ProxyError` - This is a base exception class. It is not raised directly but\\nrather all other exception classes raised by this module are derived from it.\\nThis allows an easy way to catch all proxy-related errors. It descends from `IOError`.\\n\\nAll `ProxyError` exceptions have an attribute `socket_err`, which will contain either a\\ncaught `socket.error` exception, or `None` if there wasn't any.\\n\\nclass `GeneralProxyError` - When thrown, it indicates a problem which does not fall\\ninto another category.\\n\\n* `Sent invalid data` - This error means that unexpected data has been received from\\nthe server. The most common reason is that the server specified as the proxy is\\nnot really a SOCKS4/SOCKS5/HTTP proxy, or maybe the proxy type specified is wrong.\\n\\n* `Connection closed unexpectedly` - The proxy server unexpectedly closed the connection.\\nThis may indicate that the proxy server is experiencing network or software problems.\\n\\n* `Bad proxy type` - This will be raised if the type of the proxy supplied to the\\nset_proxy function was not one of `SOCKS4`/`SOCKS5`/`HTTP`.\\n\\n* `Bad input` - This will be raised if the `connect()` method is called with bad input\\nparameters.\\n\\nclass `SOCKS5AuthError` - This indicates that the connection through a SOCKS5 server\\nfailed due to an authentication problem.\\n\\n* `Authentication is required` - This will happen if you use a SOCKS5 server which\\nrequires authentication without providing a username / password at all.\\n\\n* `All offered authentication methods were rejected` - This will happen if the proxy\\nrequires a special authentication method which is not supported by this module.\\n\\n* `Unknown username or invalid password` - Self descriptive.\\n\\nclass `SOCKS5Error` - This will be raised for SOCKS5 errors which are not related to\\nauthentication.\\nThe parameter is a tuple containing a code, as given by the server,\\nand a description of the\\nerror. The possible errors, according to the RFC, are:\\n\\n* `0x01` - General SOCKS server failure - If for any reason the proxy server is unable to\\nfulfill your request (internal server error).\\n* `0x02` - connection not allowed by ruleset - If the address you're trying to connect to\\nis blacklisted on the server or requires authentication.\\n* `0x03` - Network unreachable - The target could not be contacted. A router on the network\\nhad replied with a destination net unreachable error.\\n* `0x04` - Host unreachable - The target could not be contacted. A router on the network\\nhad replied with a destination host unreachable error.\\n* `0x05` - Connection refused - The target server has actively refused the connection\\n(the requested port is closed).\\n* `0x06` - TTL expired - The TTL value of the SYN packet from the proxy to the target server\\nhas expired. This usually means that there are network problems causing the packet\\nto be caught in a router-to-router \\\"ping-pong\\\".\\n* `0x07` - Command not supported - For instance if the server does not support UDP.\\n* `0x08` - Address type not supported - The client has provided an invalid address type.\\nWhen using this module, this error should not occur.\\n\\nclass `SOCKS4Error` - This will be raised for SOCKS4 errors. The parameter is a tuple\\ncontaining a code and a description of the error, as given by the server. The\\npossible error, according to the specification are:\\n\\n* `0x5B` - Request rejected or failed - Will be raised in the event of an failure for any\\nreason other then the two mentioned next.\\n* `0x5C` - request rejected because SOCKS server cannot connect to identd on the client -\\nThe Socks server had tried an ident lookup on your computer and has failed. In this\\ncase you should run an identd server and/or configure your firewall to allow incoming\\nconnections to local port 113 from the remote server.\\n* `0x5D` - request rejected because the client program and identd report different user-ids -\\nThe Socks server had performed an ident lookup on your computer and has received a\\ndifferent userid than the one you have provided. Change your userid (through the\\nusername parameter of the set_proxy method) to match and try again.\\n\\nclass `HTTPError` - This will be raised for HTTP errors. The message will contain\\nthe HTTP status code and provided error message.\\n\\nAfter establishing the connection, the object behaves like a standard socket.\\n\\nMethods like `makefile()` and `settimeout()` should behave just like regular sockets.\\nCall the `close()` method to close the connection.\\n\\nIn addition to the `socksocket` class, an additional function worth mentioning is the\\n`set_default_proxy` function. The parameters are the same as the `set_proxy` method.\\nThis function will set default proxy settings for newly created `socksocket` objects,\\nin which the proxy settings haven't been changed via the `set_proxy` method.\\nThis is quite useful if you wish to force 3rd party modules to use a SOCKS proxy,\\nby overriding the socket object.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    >>> socks.set_default_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \\\"socks.example.com\\\")\\n    >>> socket.socket = socks.socksocket\\n    >>> urllib.urlopen(\\\"http://www.sourceforge.net/\\\")\\n\\n\\nPROBLEMS\\n---------\\n\\nPlease open a GitHub issue at https://github.com/Anorov/PySocks\\n\",\n",

The limited instructions below for setting up a development environment are for your convenience.\\n\\n## Coding\\n\\nYou'll need Python and `pip` on the search path. Clone the Jupyter Client git repository to your computer, for example in `/my/project/jupyter_client`\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /my/projects/\\ngit clone git@github.com:jupyter/jupyter_client.git\\n```\\n\\nNow create an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)\\nand download the dependencies of code and test suite by executing:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /my/projects/jupyter_client/\\npip install -e \\\".[test]\\\"\\npytest\\n```\\n\\nThe last command runs the test suite to verify the setup. During development, you can pass filenames to `pytest`, and it will execute only those tests.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe documentation of Jupyter Client is generated from the files in `docs/` using Sphinx. Instructions for setting up Sphinx with a selection of optional modules are in the [Documentation Guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/docs-contributions/index.html). You'll also need the `make` command.\\nFor a minimal Sphinx installation to process the Jupyter Client docs, execute:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install \\\".[doc]\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe following commands build the documentation in HTML format and check for broken links:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\\nmake html linkcheck\\n```\\n\\nPoint your browser to the following URL to access the generated documentation:\\n\\n_file:///my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\\\\_build/html/index.html_\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n`jupyter-client` has adopted automatic code formatting so you shouldn't\\nneed to worry too much about your code style.\\nAs long as your code is valid,\\nthe pre-commit hook should take care of how it should look.\\nYou can invoke the pre-commit hook by hand at any time with:\\n\\n```bash\\npre-commit run\\n```\\n\\nwhich should run any autoformatting on your code\\nand tell you about any errors it couldn't fix automatically.\\nYou may also install [black integration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html)\\ninto your text editor to format code automatically.\\n\\nIf you have already committed files before setting up the pre-commit\\nhook with `pre-commit install`, you can fix everything up using\\n`pre-commit run --all-files`. You need to make the fixing commit\\nyourself after that.\\n\\nSome of the hooks only run on CI by default, but you can invoke them by\\nrunning with the `--hook-stage manual` argument.\\n\\n## About the Jupyter Development Team\\n\\nThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.\\nThis includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright\\nover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these\\ncontributions are typically only changes to the repositories.

Start of user-guide\\n\\nThe ``asttokens`` module annotates Python abstract syntax trees (ASTs) with the positions of tokens\\nand text in the source code that generated them.\\n\\nIt makes it possible for tools that work with logical AST nodes to find the particular text that\\nresulted in those nodes, for example for automated refactoring or highlighting.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\nasttokens is available on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asttokens/::\\n\\n    pip install asttokens\\n\\nThe code is on GitHub: https://github.com/gristlabs/asttokens.\\n\\nThe API Reference is here: http://asttokens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-index.html.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nASTTokens can annotate both trees built by `ast <https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html>`_,\\nAND those built by `astroid <https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid>`_.\\n\\nHere's an example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    import asttokens, ast\\n    source = \\\"Robot('blue').walk(steps=10*n)\\\"\\n    atok = asttokens.ASTTokens(source, parse=True)\\n\\nOnce the tree has been marked, nodes get ``.first_token``, ``.last_token`` attributes, and\\nthe ``ASTTokens`` object offers helpful methods:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    attr_node = next(n for n in ast.walk(atok.tree) if isinstance(n, ast.Attribute))\\n    print(atok.get_text(attr_node))\\n    start, end = attr_node.last_token.startpos, attr_node.last_token.endpos\\n    print(atok.text[:start] + 'RUN' + atok.text[end:])\\n\\nWhich produces this output:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    Robot('blue').walk\\n    Robot('blue').RUN(steps=10*n)\\n\\nThe ``ASTTokens`` object also offers methods to walk and search the list of tokens that make up\\nthe code (or a particular AST node), which is more useful and powerful than dealing with the text\\ndirectly.\\n\\n\\nContribute\\n----------\\n\\nTo contribute:\\n\\n1. Fork this repository, and clone your fork.\\n2. Install the package with test dependencies (ideally in a virtualenv) with::\\n\\n    pip install -e '.[test]'\\n\\n3. Run tests in your current interpreter with the command ``pytest`` or ``python -m pytest``.\\n4. Run tests across all supported interpreters with the ``tox`` command. You will need to have the interpreters installed separately. We recommend ``pyenv`` for that. Use ``tox -p auto`` to run the tests in parallel.\\n5. By default certain tests which take a very long time to run are skipped, but they are run in CI.\\n   These are marked using the ``pytest`` marker ``slow`` and can be run on their own with ``pytest -m slow`` or as part of the full suite with ``pytest -m ''``.\\n\",\n",

For example,\\n    `IDLE <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/191#issuecomment-230168030>`__,\\n    `ConEmu <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/254>`__ and\\n    `PyCharm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/203>`__ (also\\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/208>`__,\\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/307>`__, and\\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/454#issuecomment-335416815>`__)\\n    lack full support.\\n  * Windows: additionally may require the Python module ``colorama``\\n    to ensure nested bars stay within their respective lines.\\n\\n- Unicode:\\n\\n  * Environments which report that they support unicode will have solid smooth\\n    progressbars. The fallback is an ``ascii``-only bar.\\n  * Windows consoles often only partially support unicode and thus\\n    `often require explicit ascii=True <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/454#issuecomment-335416815>`__\\n    (also `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/499>`__). This is due to\\n    either normal-width unicode characters being incorrectly displayed as\\n    \\\"wide\\\", or some unicode characters not rendering.\\n\\n- Wrapping generators:\\n\\n  * Generator wrapper functions tend to hide the length of iterables.\\n    ``tqdm`` does not.\\n  * Replace ``tqdm(enumerate(...))`` with ``enumerate(tqdm(...))`` or\\n    ``tqdm(enumerate(x), total=len(x), ...)``.\\n    The same applies to ``numpy.ndenumerate``.\\n  * Replace ``tqdm(zip(a, b))`` with ``zip(tqdm(a), b)`` or even\\n    ``zip(tqdm(a), tqdm(b))``.\\n  * The same applies to ``itertools``.\\n  * Some useful convenience functions can be found under ``tqdm.contrib``.\\n\\n- `No intermediate output in docker-compose <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/771>`__:\\n  use ``docker-compose run`` instead of ``docker-compose up`` and ``tty: true``.\\n\\n- Overriding defaults via environment variables:\\n  e.g. in CI/cloud jobs, ``export TQDM_MININTERVAL=5`` to avoid log spam.\\n  This override logic is handled by the ``tqdm.utils.envwrap`` decorator\\n  (useful independent of ``tqdm``).\\n\\nIf you come across any other difficulties, browse and file |GitHub-Issues|.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\n|Py-Versions| |README-Hits| (Since 19 May 2016)\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    class tqdm():\\n      \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n      Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly\\n      like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating\\n      progressbar every time a value is requested.\\n      \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n      @envwrap(\\\"TQDM_\\\")  # override defaults via env vars\\n      def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,\\n                   file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1,\\n                   maxinterval=10.0, miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False,\\n                   unit='it', unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False,\\n                   smoothing=0.3, bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None,\\n                   postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, write_bytes=False,\\n                   lock_args=None, nrows=None, colour=None, delay=0):\\n\\nParameters\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n* iterable  : iterable, optional  \\n    Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.\\n    Leave blank to manually manage the updates.\\n* desc  : str, optional  \\n    Prefix for the progressbar.\\n* total  : int or float, optional  \\n    The number of expected iterations.

Use ``auto`` instead of ``autonotebook`` to suppress\\nthis warning.\\n\\nNote that notebooks will display the bar in the cell where it was created.\\nThis may be a different cell from the one where it is used.\\nIf this is not desired, either\\n\\n- delay the creation of the bar to the cell where it must be displayed, or\\n- create the bar with ``display=False``, and in a later cell call\\n  ``display(bar.container)``:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\\n    pbar = tqdm(..., display=False)\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    # different cell\\n    display(pbar.container)\\n\\nThe ``keras`` callback has a ``display()`` method which can be used likewise:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.keras import TqdmCallback\\n    cbk = TqdmCallback(display=False)\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    # different cell\\n    cbk.display()\\n    model.fit(..., verbose=0, callbacks=[cbk])\\n\\nAnother possibility is to have a single bar (near the top of the notebook)\\nwhich is constantly re-used (using ``reset()`` rather than ``close()``).\\nFor this reason, the notebook version (unlike the CLI version) does not\\nautomatically call ``close()`` upon ``Exception``.\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\\n    pbar = tqdm()\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    # different cell\\n    iterable = range(100)\\n    pbar.reset(total=len(iterable))  # initialise with new `total`\\n    for i in iterable:\\n        pbar.update()\\n    pbar.refresh()  # force print final status but don't `close()`\\n\\nCustom Integration\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo change the default arguments (such as making ``dynamic_ncols=True``),\\nsimply use built-in Python magic:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from functools import partial\\n    from tqdm import tqdm as std_tqdm\\n    tqdm = partial(std_tqdm, dynamic_ncols=True)\\n\\nFor further customisation,\\n``tqdm`` may be inherited from to create custom callbacks (as with the\\n``TqdmUpTo`` example `above <#hooks-and-callbacks>`__) or for custom frontends\\n(e.g. GUIs such as notebook or plotting packages). In the latter case:\\n\\n1. ``def __init__()`` to call ``super().__init__(..., gui=True)`` to disable\\n   terminal ``status_printer`` creation.\\n2. Redefine: ``close()``, ``clear()``, ``display()``.\\n\\nConsider overloading ``display()`` to use e.g.\\n``self.frontend(**self.format_dict)`` instead of ``self.sp(repr(self))``.\\n\\nSome submodule examples of inheritance:\\n\\n- `tqdm/notebook.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/notebook.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/gui.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/gui.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/tk.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/tk.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/contrib/slack.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/slack.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/contrib/discord.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/discord.py>`__\\n- `tqdm/contrib/telegram.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/telegram.py>`__\\n\\nDynamic Monitor/Meter\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYou can use a ``tqdm`` as a meter which is not monotonically increasing.\\nThis could be because ``n`` decreases (e.g. a CPU usage monitor) or ``total``\\nchanges.\\n\\nOne example would be recursively searching for files. The ``total`` is the\\nnumber of objects found so far, while ``n`` is the number of those objects which\\nare files (rather than folders):\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm import tqdm\\n    import os.path\\n\\n    def find_files_recursively(path, show_progress=True):\\n        files = []\\n        # total=1 assumes `path` is a file\\n        t = tqdm(total=1, unit=\\\"file\\\", disable=not show_progress)\\n        if not os.path.exists(path):\\n            raise IOError(\\\"Cannot find:\\\" + path)\\n\\n        def append_found_file(f):\\n            files.append(f)\\n            t.update()\\n\\n        def list_found_dir(path):\\n            \\\"\\\"\\\"returns os.listdir(path) assuming os.path.isdir(path)\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n            listing = os.listdir(path)\\n            # subtract 1 since a \\\"file\\\" we found was actually this directory\\n            t.total += len(listing) - 1\\n            # fancy way to give info without forcing a refresh\\n            t.set_postfix(dir=path[-10:], refresh=False)\\n            t.update(0)  # may trigger a refresh\\n            return listing\\n\\n        def recursively_search(path):\\n            if os.path.isdir(path):\\n                for f in list_found_dir(path):\\n                    recursively_search(os.path.join(path, f))\\n            else:\\n                append_found_file(path)\\n\\n        recursively_search(path)\\n        t.set_postfix(dir=path)\\n        t.close()\\n        return files\\n\\nUsing ``update(0)`` is a handy way to let ``tqdm`` decide when to trigger a\\ndisplay refresh to avoid console spamming.\\n\\nWriting messages\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThis is a work in progress (see\\n`#737 <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/737>`__).\\n\\nSince ``tqdm`` uses a simple printing mechanism to display progress bars,\\nyou should not write any message in the terminal using ``print()`` while\\na progressbar is open.\\n\\nTo write messages in the terminal without any collision with ``tqdm`` bar\\ndisplay, a ``.write()`` method is provided:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from tqdm.auto import tqdm, trange\\n    from time import sleep\\n\\n    bar = trange(10)\\n    for i in bar:\\n        # Print using tqdm class method .write()\\n        sleep(0.1)\\n        if not (i % 3):\\n            tqdm.write(\\\"Done task %i\\\" % i)\\n        # Can also use bar.write()\\n\\nBy default, this will print to standard output ``sys.stdout``. but you can\\nspecify any file-like object using the ``file`` argument. For example, this\\ncan be used to redirect the messages writing to a log file or class.\\n\\nRedirecting writing\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIf using a library that can print messages to the console, editing the library\\nby  replacing ``print()`` with ``tqdm.write()`` may not be desirable.\\nIn that case, redirecting ``sys.stdout`` to ``tqdm.write()`` is an option.\\n\\nTo redirect ``sys.stdout``, create a file-like class that will write\\nany input string to ``tqdm.write()``, and supply the arguments\\n``file=sys.stdout, dynamic_ncols=True``.\\n\\nA reusable canonical example is given below:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from time import sleep\\n    import contextlib\\n    import sys\\n    from tqdm import tqdm\\n    from tqdm.contrib import DummyTqdmFile\\n\\n\\n    @contextlib.contextmanager\\n    def std_out_err_redirect_tqdm():\\n        orig_out_err = sys.stdout, sys.stderr\\n        try:\\n            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = map(DummyTqdmFile, orig_out_err)\\n            yield orig_out_err[0]\\n        # Relay exceptions\\n        except Exception as exc:\\n            raise exc\\n        # Always restore sys.stdout/err if necessary\\n        finally:\\n            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = orig_out_err\\n\\n    def some_fun(i):\\n        print(\\\"Fee, fi, fo,\\\".split()[i])\\n\\n    # Redirect stdout to tqdm.write() (don't forget the `as save_stdout`)\\n    with std_out_err_redirect_tqdm() as orig_stdout:\\n        # tqdm needs the original stdout\\n        # and dynamic_ncols=True to autodetect console width\\n        for i in tqdm(range(3), file=orig_stdout, dynamic_ncols=True):\\n            sleep(.5)\\n            some_fun(i)\\n\\n    # After the `with`, printing is restored\\n    print(\\\"Done!\\\")\\n\\nRedirecting ``logging``\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSimilar to ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` as detailed above, console ``logging``\\nmay also be redirected to ``tqdm.write()``.\\n\\nWarning: if also redirecting ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr``, make sure to\\nredirect ``logging`` first if needed.\\n\\nHelper methods are available in ``tqdm.contrib.logging``. For example:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    import logging\\n    from tqdm import trange\\n    from tqdm.contrib.logging import logging_redirect_tqdm\\n\\n    LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n\\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\\n        with logging_redirect_tqdm():\\n            for i in trange(9):\\n                if i == 4:\\n                    LOG.info(\\\"console logging redirected to `tqdm.write()`\\\")\\n        # logging restored\\n\\nMonitoring thread, intervals and miniters\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n``tqdm`` implements a few tricks to increase efficiency and reduce overhead.\\n\\n- Avoid unnecessary frequent bar refreshing: ``mininterval`` defines how long\\n  to wait between each refresh. ``tqdm`` always gets updated in the background,\\n  but it will display only every ``mininterval``.\\n- Reduce number of calls to check system clock/time.\\n- ``mininterval`` is more intuitive to configure than ``miniters``.\\n  A clever adjustment system ``dynamic_miniters`` will automatically adjust\\n  ``miniters`` to the amount of iterations that fit into time ``mininterval``.\\n  Essentially, ``tqdm`` will check if it's time to print without actually\\n  checking time. This behaviour can be still be bypassed by manually setting\\n  ``miniters``.\\n\\nHowever, consider a case with a combination of fast and slow iterations.\\nAfter a few fast iterations, ``dynamic_miniters`` will set ``miniters`` to a\\nlarge number. When iteration rate subsequently slows, ``miniters`` will\\nremain large and thus reduce display update frequency. To address this:\\n\\n- ``maxinterval`` defines the maximum time between display refreshes.\\n  A concurrent monitoring thread checks for overdue updates and forces one\\n  where necessary.\\n\\nThe monitoring thread should not have a noticeable overhead, and guarantees\\nupdates at least every 10 seconds by default.\\nThis value can be directly changed by setting the ``monitor_interval`` of\\nany ``tqdm`` instance (i.e. ``t = tqdm.tqdm(...); t.monitor_interval = 2``).\\nThe monitor thread may be disabled application-wide by setting\\n``tqdm.tqdm.monitor_interval = 0`` before instantiation of any ``tqdm`` bar.\\n\\n\\nMerch\\n-----\\n\\nYou can buy `tqdm branded merch <https://tqdm.github.io/merch>`__ now!\\n\\nContributions\\n-------------\\n\\n|GitHub-Commits|

      "            \"description\": \"# pyjson5\\n\\nA Python implementation of the JSON5 data format.\\n\\n[JSON5](https://json5.org) extends the\\n[JSON](http://www.json.org) data interchange format to make it\\nslightly more usable as a configuration language:\\n\\n* JavaScript-style comments (both single and multi-line) are legal.\\n\\n* Object keys may be unquoted if they are legal ECMAScript identifiers\\n\\n* Objects and arrays may end with trailing commas.\\n\\n* Strings can be single-quoted, and multi-line string literals are allowed.\\n\\nThere are a few other more minor extensions to JSON; see the above page for\\nthe full details.\\n\\nThis project implements a reader and writer implementation for Python;\\nwhere possible, it mirrors the\\n[standard Python JSON API](https://docs.python.org/library/json.html)\\npackage for ease of use.\\n\\nThere is one notable difference from the JSON api: the `load()` and\\n`loads()` methods support optionally checking for (and rejecting) duplicate\\nobject keys; pass `allow_duplicate_keys=False` to do so (duplicates are\\nallowed by default).\\n\\nThis is an early release. It has been reasonably well-tested, but it is\\n**SLOW**. It can be 1000-6000x slower than the C-optimized JSON module,\\nand is 200x slower (or more) than the pure Python JSON module.\\n\\n**Please Note:** This library only handles JSON5 documents, it does not\\nallow you to read arbitrary JavaScript. For example, bare integers can\\nbe legal object keys in JavaScript, but they aren't in JSON5.\\n\\n## Known issues\\n\\n* Did I mention that it is **SLOW**?\\n\\n* The implementation follows Python3's `json` implementation where\\n  possible. This means that the `encoding` method to `dump()` is\\n  ignored, and unicode strings are always returned.\\n\\n* The `cls` keyword argument that `json.load()`/`json.loads()` accepts\\n  to specify a custom subclass of ``JSONDecoder`` is not and will not be\\n  supported, because this implementation uses a completely different\\n  approach to parsing strings and doesn't have anything like the\\n  `JSONDecoder` class.\\n\\n* The `cls` keyword argument that `json.dump()`/`json.dumps()` accepts\\n  is also not supported, for consistency with `json5.load()`. The `default`\\n  keyword *is* supported, though, and might be able to serve as a\\n  workaround.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n`json5` have no runtime dependencies and it is supported on Python version 3.8\\nor later. However, in order to develop and build the package you need a\\nbunch of extra tools and the latest versions of those tools may require 3.9\\nor later. You can install the extra environment on 3.8 (and get older versions\\nof the tools), but they may not run completely cleanly.\\n\\n#### On Mac\\n\\nThe easiest thing to do is to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) and\\nuse `uv` and the `//run` script to develop things. See `./run --help` for\\nthe various commands that are supported. `glop` is the parser generator\\ntool used to generate a parser from the grammar in `json5/json5.g`.\\n\\n```\\n$ brew install uv\\n$ git clone https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5\\n$ git clone https://github.com/dpranke/glop\\n$ cd pyjson5\\n$ source $(./run devenv)  # To activate a venv w/ all the needed dev tools.\\n```\\n\\n#### On other platforms\\n\\nInstall `uv` via whatever mechanism is appropriate.\\n\\n### Create the venv\\n\\n```\\n$ ./run devenv\\n```\\n\\n(This calls `uv sync --extra dev`.)\\n\\n### Running the tests\\n\\n```\\n$ ./run tests\\n```\\n\\n### Updating the packages\\n\\n```\\n# Update the version in json5/version.py to $VERSION, which should be of\\n# the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are numbers.\\n$ ./run regen\\n$ ./run presubmit\\n$ git commit -a -m \\\"Bump the version to $VERSION\\\"\\n$ git tag \\\"v$VERSION\\\"\\n$ ./run build\\n$ ./run publish --prod\\n$ git push origin\\n$ git push --tags origin\\n```\\n\\n(Assuming you have upload privileges to PyPI and the GitHub repo, of course.)\\n\\n## Version History / Release Notes\\n\\n* v0.12.0 (2025-04-03)\\n    * Roll back pyproject.toml change for licensing so that we can still\\n      build the package on 3.8.\\n\\n* v0.12.0dev0 (prerelease)\\n    * Upgrade devenv package dependencies to latest versions; they now need\\n      Python 3.9 or newer, though json5 itself still supports 3.8.\\n\\n* v0.11.0 (2025-04-01)\\n    * Add a couple examples to the documentation and run doctest over\\n      them.\\n    * Fix a typing issue in dump and dumps with the `cls` argument; turns\\n      out mypy was right and I was wrong and I didn't realize it :).\\n    * Introduce a new `parse` method that can be used to iterate through\\n      a string, extracting multiple values.\\n    * Add a new `consume_trailing` parameter to `load`/`loads`/`parse`\\n      that specifies whether to keep parsing after a valid object is\\n      reached. By default, this is True and the string must only contain\\n      trailing whitespace. If set to False, parsing will stop when a\\n      valid object is reached.\\n    * Add a new `start` parameter to `load`/`loads`/`parse` to specify\\n      the zero-based offset to start parsing the string or file from.\\n    * [GitHub issue #60](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/60).\\n      Fix a bug where we were attempting to allow '--4' as a valid number.\\n\\n* v0.10.0 (2024-11-25)\\n    * [GitHub issue #57](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/57).\\n      Added a `JSON5Encoder` class that can be overridden to do custom\\n      encoding of values. This class is vaguely similar to the `JSONEncoder`\\n      class in the standard `json` library, except that it has an\\n      `encode()` method that can be overridden to customize *any*\\n      value, not just ones the standard encoder doesn't know how to handle.\\n      It does also support a `default()` method that can be used to\\n      encode things not normally encodable, like the JSONEncoder class.\\n      It does not support an `iterencode` method. One could probably\\n      be added in the future, although exactly how that would work and\\n      interact with `encode` is a little unclear.\\n    * Restructured the code to use the new encoder class; doing so actually\\n      allowed me to delete a bunch of tediously duplicative code.\\n    * Added a new `quote_style` argument to `dump()`/`dumps()` to control\\n      how strings are encoded by default. For compatibility with older\\n      versions of the json5 library and the standard json library, it\\n      uses `QuoteStyle.ALWAYS_DOUBLE` which encodes all strings with double\\n      quotes all the time. You can also configure it to use single quotes\\n      all the time (`ALWAYS_SINGLE`), and to switch between single and double\\n      when doing so eliminates a need to escape quotes (`PREFER_SINGLE` and\\n      `PREFER_DOUBLE`). This also adds a `--quote-style` argument to\\n      `python -m json5`.\\n    * This release has a fair number of changes, but is intended to be\\n      completely backwards-compatible. Code without changes should run exactly\\n      as it did before.\\n* v0.9.28 (2024-11-11)\\n    * Fix GitHub CI to install `uv` so `./run tests` works properly.\\n    * Mark Python3.13 as supported in package metadata.\\n    * Update dev package dependencies (note that the latest versions\\n      of coverage and pylint no longer work w/ Python3.8)\\n* v0.9.27 (2024-11-10)\\n    * Fix typo in //README.md\\n* v0.9.26 (2024-11-10)\\n    * [GitHub issue #82](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/82)\\n      Add support for the `strict` parameter to `load()`/`loads()`.\\n    * Significantly rework the infra and the `run` script to be\\n      contemporary.\\n* v0.9.25 (2024-04-12)\\n    * [GitHub issue #81](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/81)\\n      Explicitly specify the directory to use for the package in\\n      pyproject.toml.\\n* v0.9.24 (2024-03-16)\\n    * Update GitHub workflow config to remove unnecessary steps and\\n      run on pull requests as well as commits.\\n    * Added note about removing `hypothesize` in v0.9.23.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.23 (2024-03-16)\\n    * Lots of cleanup:\\n      * Removed old code needed for Python2 compatibility.\\n      * Removed tests using `hypothesize`. This ran model-based checks\\n        and didn't really add anything useful in terms of coverage to\\n        the test suite, and it introduced dependencies and slowed down\\n        the tests significantly. It was a good experiment but I think\\n        we're better off without it.\\n      * Got everything linting cleanly with pylint 3.1 and `ruff check`\\n        using ruff 0.3.3 (Note that commit message in 00d73a3 says pylint\\n        3.11, which is a typo).\\n      * Code reformatted with `ruff format`\\n      * Added missing tests to bring coverage up to 100%.\\n      * Lots of minor code changes as the result of linting and coverage\\n        testing, but no intentional functional differences.\\n* v0.9.22 (2024-03-06)\\n    * Attempt to fix the GitHub CI configuration now that setup.py\\n      is gone. Also, test on 3.12 instead of 3.11.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.21 (2024-03-06)\\n    * Moved the benchmarks/*.json data files' license information\\n      to //LICENSE to (hopefully) make the Google linter happy.\\n* v0.9.20 (2024-03-03)\\n    * Added `json5.__version__` in addition to `json5.VERSION`.\\n    * More packaging modernization (no more setup.{cfg,py} files).\\n    * Mark Python3.12 as supported in project.classifiers.\\n    * Updated the `//run` script to use python3.\\n* v0.9.19 (2024-03-03)\\n    * Replaced the benchmarking data files that came from chromium.org with\\n      three files obtained from other datasets on GitHub. Since this repo\\n      is vendored into the chromium/src repo it was occasionally confusing\\n      people who thought the data was actually used for non-benchmarking\\n      purposes and thus updating it for whatever reason.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.18 (2024-02-29)\\n    * Add typing information to the module. This is kind of a big change,\\n      but there should be no functional differences.\\n* v0.9.17 (2024-02-19)\\n    * Move from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`.\\n    * No code changes (other than the version increasing).\\n* v0.9.16 (2024-02-19)\\n    * Drop Python2 from `setup.py`\\n    * Add minimal packaging instructions to `//README.md`.\\n* v0.9.15 (2024-02-19)\\n    * Merge in [Pull request #66](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/66)\\n      to include the tests and sample file in a source distribution.\\n* v0.9.14 (2023-05-14)\\n    * [GitHub issue #63](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/63)\\n      Handle `+Infinity` as well as `-Infinity` and `Infinity`.\\n* v0.9.13 (2023-03-16)\\n    * [GitHub PR #64](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/64)\\n      Remove a field from one of the JSON benchmark files to\\n      reduce confusion in Chromium.\\n    * No code changes.\\n* v0.9.12 (2023-01-02)\\n    * Fix GitHub Actions config file to no longer test against\\n      Python 3.6 or 3.7. For now we will only test against an\\n      \\\"oldest\\\" release (3.8 in this case) and a \\\"current\\\"\\n      release (3.11 in this case).\\n* v0.9.11 (2023-01-02)\\n    * [GitHub issue #60](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/60)\\n      Fixed minor Python2 compatibility issue by referring to\\n      `float(\\\"inf\\\")` instead of `math.inf`.\\n* v0.9.10 (2022-08-18)\\n    * [GitHub issue #58](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/58)\\n      Updated the //README.md to be clear that parsing arbitrary JS\\n      code may not work.\\n    * Otherwise, no code changes.\\n* v0.9.9 (2022-08-01)\\n    * [GitHub issue #57](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/57)\\n      Fixed serialization for objects that subclass `int` or `float`:\\n      Previously we would use the objects __str__ implementation, but\\n      that might result in an illegal JSON5 value if the object had\\n      customized __str__ to return something illegal. Instead,\\n      we follow the lead of the `JSON` module and call `int.__repr__`\\n      or `float.__repr__` directly.\\n    * While I was at it, I added tests for dumps(-inf) and dumps(nan)\\n      when those were supposed to be disallowed by `allow_nan=False`.\\n* v0.9.8 (2022-05-08)\\n    * [GitHub issue #47](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/47)\\n      Fixed error reporting in some cases due to how parsing was handling\\n      nested rules in the grammar - previously the reported location for\\n      the error could be far away from the point where it actually happened.\\n\\n* v0.9.7 (2022-05-06)\\n    * [GitHub issue #52](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/52)\\n      Fixed behavior of `default` fn in `dump` and `dumps`. Previously\\n      we didn't require the function to return a string, and so we could\\n      end up returning something that wasn't actually valid. This change\\n      now matches the behavior in the `json` module. *Note: This is a\\n      potentially breaking change.*\\n* v0.9.6 (2021-06-21)\\n    * Bump development status classifier to 5 - Production/Stable, which\\n      the library feels like it is at this point. If I do end up significantly\\n      reworking things to speed it up and/or to add round-trip editing,\\n      that'll likely be a 2.0. If this version has no reported issues,\\n      I'll likely promote it to 1.0.\\n    * Also bump the tested Python versions to 2.7, 3.8 and 3.9, though\\n      earlier Python3 versions will likely continue to work as well.\\n    * [GitHub issue #46](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/36)\\n      Fix incorrect serialization of custom subtypes\\n    * Make it possible to run the tests if `hypothesis` isn't installed.\\n\\n* v0.9.5 (2020-05-26)\\n    * Miscellaneous non-source cleanups in the repo, including setting\\n      up GitHub Actions for a CI system. No changes to the library from\\n      v0.9.4, other than updating the version.\\n\\n* v0.9.4 (2020-03-26)\\n    * [GitHub pull #38](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/38)\\n      Fix from fredrik@fornwall.net for dumps() crashing when passed\\n      an empty string as a key in an object.\\n\\n* v0.9.3 (2020-03-17)\\n    * [GitHub pull #35](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/35)\\n      Fix from pastelmind@ for dump() not passing the right args to dumps().\\n    * Fix from p.skouzos@novafutur.com to remove the tests directory from\\n      the setup call, making the package a bit smaller.\\n\\n* v0.9.2 (2020-03-02)\\n    * [GitHub pull #34](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/34)\\n      Fix from roosephu@ for a badly formatted nested list.\\n\\n* v0.9.1 (2020-02-09)\\n    * [GitHub issue #33](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/33):\\n       Fix stray trailing comma when dumping an object with an invalid key.\\n\\n* v0.9.0 (2020-01-30)\\n    * [GitHub issue #29](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/29):\\n       Fix an issue where objects keys that started with a reserved\\n       word were incorrectly quoted.\\n    * [GitHub issue #30](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/30):\\n       Fix an issue where dumps() incorrectly thought a data structure\\n       was cyclic in some cases.\\n    * [GitHub issue #32](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/32):\\n       Allow for non-string keys in dicts passed to ``dump()``/``dumps()``.\\n       Add an ``allow_duplicate_keys=False`` to prevent possible\\n       ill-formed JSON that might result.\\n\\n* v0.8.5 (2019-07-04)\\n    * [GitHub issue #25](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/25):\\n      Add LICENSE and README.md to the dist.\\n    * [GitHub issue #26](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/26):\\n      Fix printing of empty arrays and objects with indentation, fix\\n      misreporting of the position on parse failures in some cases.\\n\\n* v0.8.4 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Updated the version history, too.\\n\\n* v0.8.3 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Tweaked the README, bumped the version, forgot to update the version\\n      history :).\\n\\n* v0.8.2 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Actually bump the version properly, to 0.8.2.\\n\\n* v0.8.1 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Fix bug in setup.py that messed up the description. Unfortunately,\\n      I forgot to bump the version for this, so this also identifies as 0.8.0.\\n\\n* v0.8.0 (2019-06-11)\\n    * Add `allow_duplicate_keys=True` as a default argument to\\n      `json5.load()`/`json5.loads()`. If you set the key to `False`, duplicate\\n      keys in a single dict will be rejected. The default is set to `True`\\n      for compatibility with `json.load()`, earlier versions of json5, and\\n      because it's simply not clear if people would want duplicate checking\\n      enabled by default.\\n\\n* v0.7 (2019-03-31)\\n    * Changes dump()/dumps() to not quote object keys by default if they are\\n      legal identifiers. Passing `quote_keys=True` will turn that off\\n      and always quote object keys.\\n    * Changes dump()/dumps() to insert trailing commas after the last item\\n      in an array or an object if the object is printed across multiple lines\\n      (i.e., if `indent` is not None). Passing `trailing_commas=False` will\\n      turn that off.\\n    * The `json5.tool` command line tool now supports the `--indent`,\\n      `--[no-]quote-keys`, and `--[no-]trailing-commas` flags to allow\\n      for more control over the output, in addition to the existing\\n      `--as-json` flag.\\n    * The `json5.tool` command line tool no longer supports reading from\\n      multiple files, you can now only read from a single file or\\n      from standard input.\\n    * The implementation no longer relies on the standard `json` module\\n      for anything. The output should still match the json module (except\\n      as noted above) and discrepancies should be reported as bugs.\\n\\n* v0.6.2 (2019-03-08)\\n    * Fix [GitHub issue #23](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/23) and\\n      pass through unrecognized escape sequences.\\n\\n* v0.6.1 (2018-05-22)\\n    * Cleaned up a couple minor nits in the package.\\n\\n* v0.6.0 (2017-11-28)\\n    * First implementation that attempted to implement 100% of the spec.\\n\\n* v0.5.0 (2017-09-04)\\n    * First implementation that supported the full set of kwargs that\\n      the `json` module supports.\\n\",\n",

Sending HTTP requests.\\n\\nIt does not provide any high level model abstractions over the API,\\ndoes not handle redirects, multipart uploads, building authentication headers,\\ntransparent HTTP caching, URL parsing, session cookie handling,\\ncontent or charset decoding, handling JSON, environment based configuration\\ndefaults, or any of that Jazz.\\n\\nSome things HTTP Core does do:\\n\\n* Sending HTTP requests.\\n* Thread-safe / task-safe connection pooling.\\n* HTTP(S) proxy & SOCKS proxy support.\\n* Supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.\\n* Provides both sync and async interfaces.\\n* Async backend support for `asyncio` and `trio`.\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\nPython 3.8+\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nFor HTTP/1.1 only support, install with:\\n\\n```shell\\n$ pip install httpcore\\n```\\n\\nThere are also a number of optional extras available...\\n\\n```shell\\n$ pip install httpcore['asyncio,trio,http2,socks']\\n```\\n\\n## Sending requests\\n\\nSend an HTTP request:\\n\\n```python\\nimport httpcore\\n\\nresponse = httpcore.request(\\\"GET\\\", \\\"https://www.example.com/\\\")\\n\\nprint(response)\\n# <Response [200]>\\nprint(response.status)\\n# 200\\nprint(response.headers)\\n# [(b'Accept-Ranges', b'bytes'), (b'Age', b'557328'), (b'Cache-Control', b'max-age=604800'), ...]\\nprint(response.content)\\n# b'<!doctype html>\\\\n<html>\\\\n<head>\\\\n<title>Example Domain</title>\\\\n\\\\n<meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"/>\\\\n ...'\\n```\\n\\nThe top-level `httpcore.request()` function is provided for convenience. In practice whenever you're working with `httpcore` you'll want to use the connection pooling functionality that it provides.\\n\\n```python\\nimport httpcore\\n\\nhttp = httpcore.ConnectionPool()\\nresponse = http.request(\\\"GET\\\", \\\"https://www.example.com/\\\")\\n```\\n\\nOnce you're ready to get going, [head over to the documentation](https://www.encode.io/httpcore/).\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nYou *probably* don't want to be using HTTP Core directly. It might make sense if\\nyou're writing something like a proxy service in Python, and you just want\\nsomething at the lowest possible level, but more typically you'll want to use\\na higher level client library, such as `httpx`.\\n\\nThe motivation for `httpcore` is:\\n\\n* To provide a reusable low-level client library, that other packages can then build on top of.\\n* To provide a *really clear interface split* between the networking code and client logic,\\n  so that each is easier to understand and reason about in isolation.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\nThe `httpcore` package has the following dependencies...\\n\\n* `h11`\\n* `certifi`\\n\\nAnd the following optional extras...\\n\\n* `anyio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['asyncio']`.\\n* `trio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['trio']`.\\n* `h2` - Required by `pip install httpcore['http2']`.\\n* `socksio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['socks']`.\\n\\n## Versioning\\n\\nWe use [SEMVER for our versioning policy](https://semver.org/).\\n\\nFor changes between package versions please see our [project changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\nWe recommend pinning your requirements either the most current major version, or a more specific version range:\\n\\n```python\\npip install 'httpcore==1.*'\\n```\\n# Changelog\\n\\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\\n\\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\\n\\n## Version 1.0.9 (April 24th, 2025)\\n\\n- Resolve https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj with h11 dependency update.

This extension is needed for the HTTPX cli, in order to...\\n\\n* Log the point at which the connection is established, and the IP/port on which it is made.\\n* Determine if the outgoing request should log as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, rather than having to assume it's HTTP/2 if the --http2 flag was passed. (Which may not actually be true.)\\n* Log SSL version info / certificate info.\\n\\nNote that `curio` support is not currently available in 0.14.0. If you're using `httpcore` with `curio` please get in touch, so we can assess if we ought to prioritize it as a feature or not.\\n\\n## 0.13.7 (September 13th, 2021)\\n\\n- Fix broken error messaging when URL scheme is missing, or a non HTTP(S) scheme is used. (Pull #403)\\n\\n## 0.13.6 (June 15th, 2021)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Close sockets when read or write timeouts occur. (Pull #365)\\n\\n## 0.13.5 (June 14th, 2021)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Resolved niggles with AnyIO EOF behaviours. (Pull #358, #362)\\n\\n## 0.13.4 (June 9th, 2021)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Improved error messaging when URL scheme is missing, or a non HTTP(S) scheme is used. (Pull #354)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Switched to `anyio` as the default backend implementation when running with `asyncio`. Resolves some awkward [TLS timeout issues](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1511).\\n\\n## 0.13.3 (May 6th, 2021)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Support HTTP/2 prior knowledge, using `httpcore.SyncConnectionPool(http1=False)`. (Pull #333)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Handle cases where environment does not provide `select.poll` support. (Pull #331)\\n\\n## 0.13.2 (April 29th, 2021)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Improve error message for specific case of `RemoteProtocolError` where server disconnects without sending a response. (Pull #313)\\n\\n## 0.13.1 (April 28th, 2021)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- More resiliant testing for closed connections. (Pull #311)\\n- Don't raise exceptions on ungraceful connection closes. (Pull #310)\\n\\n## 0.13.0 (April 21st, 2021)\\n\\nThe 0.13 release updates the core API in order to match the HTTPX Transport API,\\nintroduced in HTTPX 0.18 onwards.\\n\\nAn example of making requests with the new interface is:\\n\\n```python\\nwith httpcore.SyncConnectionPool() as http:\\n    status_code, headers, stream, extensions = http.handle_request(\\n        method=b'GET',\\n        url=(b'https', b'example.org', 443, b'/'),\\n        headers=[(b'host', b'example.org'), (b'user-agent', b'httpcore')]\\n        stream=httpcore.ByteStream(b''),\\n        extensions={}\\n    )\\n    body = stream.read()\\n    print(status_code, body)\\n```\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- The `.request()` method is now `handle_request()`. (Pull #296)\\n- The `.arequest()` method is now `.handle_async_request()`. (Pull #296)\\n- The `headers` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\\n- The `stream` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\\n- The `ext` argument is now named `extensions`, and is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\\n- The `\\\"reason\\\"` extension keyword is now named `\\\"reason_phrase\\\"`. (Pull #296)\\n- The `\\\"reason_phrase\\\"` and `\\\"http_version\\\"` extensions now use byte strings for their values. (Pull #296)\\n- The `httpcore.PlainByteStream()` class becomes `httpcore.ByteStream()`. (Pull #296)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Streams now support a `.read()` interface. (Pull #296)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Task cancellation no longer leaks connections from the connection pool. (Pull #305)\\n\\n## 0.12.3 (December 7th, 2020)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Abort SSL connections on close rather than waiting for remote EOF when using `asyncio`.  (Pull #167)\\n- Fix exception raised in case of connect timeouts when using the `anyio` backend. (Pull #236)\\n- Fix `Host` header precedence for `:authority` in HTTP/2. (Pull #241, #243)\\n- Handle extra edge case when detecting for socket readability when using `asyncio`. (Pull #242, #244)\\n- Fix `asyncio` SSL warning when using proxy tunneling. (Pull #249)\\n\\n## 0.12.2 (November 20th, 2020)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Properly wrap connect errors on the asyncio backend. (Pull #235)\\n- Fix `ImportError` occurring on Python 3.9 when using the HTTP/1.1 sync client in a multithreaded context. (Pull #237)\\n\\n## 0.12.1 (November 7th, 2020)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Add connect retries. (Pull #221)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Tweak detection of dropped connections, resolving an issue with open files limits on Linux. (Pull #185)\\n- Avoid leaking connections when establishing an HTTP tunnel to a proxy has failed. (Pull #223)\\n- Properly wrap OS errors when using `trio`. (Pull #225)\\n\\n## 0.12.0 (October 6th, 2020)\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- HTTP header casing is now preserved, rather than always sent in lowercase. (#216 and python-hyper/h11#104)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Add Python 3.9 to officially supported versions.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Gracefully handle a stdlib asyncio bug when a connection is closed while it is in a paused-for-reading state. (#201)\\n\\n## 0.11.1 (September 28nd, 2020)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Add await to async semaphore release() coroutine (#197)\\n- Drop incorrect curio classifier (#192)\\n\\n## 0.11.0 (September 22nd, 2020)\\n\\nThe Transport API with 0.11.0 has a couple of significant changes.\\n\\nFirstly we've moved changed the request interface in order to allow extensions, which will later enable us to support features\\nsuch as trailing headers, HTTP/2 server push, and CONNECT/Upgrade connections.\\n\\nThe interface changes from:\\n\\n```python\\ndef request(method, url, headers, stream, timeout):\\n    return (http_version, status_code, reason, headers, stream)\\n```\\n\\nTo instead including an optional dictionary of extensions on the request and response:\\n\\n```python\\ndef request(method, url, headers, stream, ext):\\n    return (status_code, headers, stream, ext)\\n```\\n\\nHaving an open-ended extensions point will allow us to add later support for various optional features, that wouldn't otherwise be supported without these API changes.\\n\\nIn particular:\\n\\n* Trailing headers support.\\n* HTTP/2 Server Push\\n* sendfile.\\n* Exposing raw connection on CONNECT, Upgrade, HTTP/2 bi-di streaming.\\n* Exposing debug information out of the API, including template name, template context.\\n\\nCurrently extensions are limited to:\\n\\n* request: `timeout` - Optional. Timeout dictionary.\\n* response: `http_version` - Optional. Include the HTTP version used on the response.\\n* response: `reason` - Optional. Include the reason phrase used on the response. Only valid with HTTP/1.*.\\n\\nSee https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/1274#issuecomment-694884553 for the history behind this.\\n\\nSecondly, the async version of `request` is now namespaced as `arequest`.\\n\\nThis allows concrete transports to support both sync and async implementations on the same class.\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Add curio support. (Pull #168)\\n- Add anyio support, with `backend=\\\"anyio\\\"`. (Pull #169)\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- Update the Transport API to use 'ext' for optional extensions. (Pull #190)\\n- Update the Transport API to use `.request` and `.arequest` so implementations can support both sync and async. (Pull #189)\\n\\n## 0.10.2 (August 20th, 2020)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Added Unix Domain Socket support. (Pull #139)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Always include the port on proxy CONNECT requests. (Pull #154)\\n- Fix `max_keepalive_connections` configuration. (Pull #153)\\n- Fixes behaviour in HTTP/1.1 where server disconnects can be used to signal the end of the response body. (Pull #164)\\n\\n## 0.10.1 (August 7th, 2020)\\n\\n- Include `max_keepalive_connections` on `AsyncHTTPProxy`/`SyncHTTPProxy` classes.\\n\\n## 0.10.0 (August 7th, 2020)\\n\\nThe most notable change in the 0.10.0 release is that HTTP/2 support is now fully optional.\\n\\nUse either `pip install httpcore` for HTTP/1.1 support only, or `pip install httpcore[http2]` for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support.\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- HTTP/2 support becomes optional. (Pull #121, #130)\\n- Add `local_address=...` support. (Pull #100, #134)\\n- Add `PlainByteStream`, `IteratorByteStream`, `AsyncIteratorByteStream`.

It is released under a two-clauses\\nBSD license, i.e. basically you can do whatever you want with it but I am not\\nresponsible.\\n\\nInstallation\\n-------------\\n\\nIf you are lazy, just perform\\n\\n ``$ pip install decorator``\\n\\nwhich will install just the module on your system.\\n\\nIf you prefer to install the full distribution from source, including\\nthe documentation, clone the `GitHub repo`_ or download the tarball_, unpack it and run\\n\\n ``$ pip install .``\\n\\nin the main directory, possibly as superuser.\\n\\n.. _tarball: https://pypi.org/project/decorator/#files\\n.. _GitHub repo: https://github.com/micheles/decorator\\n\\nTesting\\n--------\\n\\nIf you have the source code installation you can run the tests with\\n\\n `$ python src/tests/test.py -v`\\n\\nor (if you have setuptools installed)\\n\\n `$ python setup.py test`\\n\\nNotice that you may run into trouble if in your system there\\nis an older version of the decorator module; in such a case remove the\\nold version. It is safe even to copy the module `decorator.py` over\\nan existing one, since we kept backward-compatibility for a long time.\\n\\nRepository\\n---------------\\n\\nThe project is hosted on GitHub. You can look at the source here:\\n\\n https://github.com/micheles/decorator\\n\\nDocumentation\\n---------------\\n\\nThe documentation has been moved to https://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/master/docs/documentation.md\\n\\nFrom there you can get a PDF version by simply using the print\\nfunctionality of your browser.\\n\\nHere is the documentation for previous versions of the module:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.3.2/docs/tests.documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.2.1/docs/tests.documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.1.2/docs/tests.documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/4.0.0/documentation.rst\\nhttps://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/3.4.2/documentation.rst\\n\\nFor the impatient\\n-----------------\\n\\nHere is an example of how to define a family of decorators tracing slow\\noperations:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n   from decorator import decorator\\n\\n   @decorator\\n   def warn_slow(func, timelimit=60, *args, **kw):\\n       t0 = time.time()\\n       result = func(*args, **kw)\\n       dt = time.time() - t0\\n       if dt > timelimit:\\n           logging.warning('%s took %d seconds', func.__name__, dt)\\n       else:\\n           logging.info('%s took %d seconds', func.__name__, dt)\\n       return result\\n\\n   @warn_slow  # warn if it takes more than 1 minute\\n   def preprocess_input_files(inputdir, tempdir):\\n       ...\\n\\n   @warn_slow(timelimit=600)  # warn if it takes more than 10 minutes\\n   def run_calculation(tempdir, outdir):\\n       ...\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\",\n",

Note that this requires Cython to\\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home page.\\n\\n\\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become available at\\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-6.0 .\\nRunning ``pip install https://github.com/lxml/lxml/archive/refs/heads/lxml-6.0.tar.gz``\\nwill install the unreleased branch state as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.\\nNote that this requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\\n\\n6.0.0 (2025-06-26)\\n==================\\n\\nFeatures added\\n--------------\\n\\n* GH#463: ``lxml.html.diff`` is faster and provides structurally better diffs.\\n  Original patch by Steven Fernandez.\\n\\n* GH#405: The factories ``Element`` and ``ElementTree`` can now be used in type hints.\\n\\n* GH#448: Parsing from ``memoryview`` and other buffers is supported to allow zero-copy parsing.\\n\\n* GH#437: ``lxml.html.builder`` was missing several HTML5 tag names.\\n  Patch by Nick Tarleton.\\n\\n* GH#458: ``CDATA`` can now be written into the incremental ``xmlfile()`` writer.\\n  Original patch by Lane Shaw.\\n\\n* A new parser option ``decompress=False`` was added that controls the automatic\\n  input decompression when using libxml2 2.15.0 or later.  Disabling this option\\n  by default will effectively prevent decompression bombs when handling untrusted\\n  input.  Code that depends on automatic decompression must enable this option.\\n  Note that libxml2 2.15.0 was not released yet, so this option currently has no\\n  effect but can already be used.\\n\\n* The set of compile time / runtime supported libxml2 feature names is available as\\n  ``etree.LIBXML_COMPILED_FEATURES`` and ``etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.\\n  This currently includes\\n  ``catalog``, ``ftp``, ``html``, ``http``, ``iconv``, ``icu``,\\n  ``lzma``, ``regexp``, ``schematron``, ``xmlschema``, ``xpath``, ``zlib``.\\n\\nBugs fixed\\n----------\\n\\n* GH#353: Predicates in ``.find*()`` could mishandle tag indices if a default namespace is provided.\\n  Original patch by Luise K.\\n\\n* GH#272: The ``head`` and ``body`` properties of ``lxml.html`` elements failed if no such element\\n  was found.  They now return ``None`` instead.\\n  Original patch by FVolral.\\n\\n* Tag names provided by code (API, not data) that are longer than ``INT_MAX``\\n  could be truncated or mishandled in other ways.\\n\\n* ``.text_content()`` on ``lxml.html`` elements accidentally returned a \\\"smart string\\\"\\n  without additional information.  It now returns a plain string.\\n\\n* LP#2109931: When building lxml with coverage reporting, it now disables the ``sys.monitoring``\\n  support due to the lack of support in https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1790\\n\\nOther changes\\n-------------\\n\\n* Support for Python < 3.8 was removed.\\n\\n* Parsing directly from zlib (or lzma) compressed data is now considered an optional\\n  feature in lxml.  It may get removed from libxml2 at some point for security reasons\\n  (compression bombs) and is therefore no longer guaranteed to be available in lxml.\\n\\n  As of this release, zlib support is still normally available in the binary wheels\\n  but may get disabled or removed in later (x.y.0) releases.  To test the availability,\\n  use ``\\\"zlib\\\" in etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.\\n\\n* The ``Schematron`` class is deprecated and will become non-functional in a future lxml version.\\n  The feature will soon be removed from libxml2 and stop being available.\\n\\n* GH#438: Wheels include the ``arm7l`` target.\\n\\n* GH#465: Windows wheels include the ``arm64`` target.\\n  Patch by Finn Womack.\\n\\n* Binary wheels use the library versions libxml2 2.14.4 and libxslt 1.1.43.\\n  Note that this disables direct HTTP and FTP support for parsing from URLs.\\n  Use Python URL request tools instead (which usually also support HTTPS).\\n  To test the availability, use ``\\\"http\\\" in etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.\\n\\n* Windows binary wheels use the library versions libxml2 2.11.9, libxslt 1.1.39 and libiconv 1.17.\\n  They are now based on VS-2022.\\n\\n* Built using Cython 3.1.2.\\n\\n* The debug methods ``MemDebug.dump()`` and ``MemDebug.show()`` were removed completely.\\n  libxml2 2.13.0 discarded this feature.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms\\nof data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full Python\\nHTTP implementation.\\n\\nTo install it, just run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    $ python -m pip install h2\\n\\nDocumentation\\n=============\\n\\nDocumentation is available at https://h2.readthedocs.io .\\n\\nContributing\\n============\\n\\n``h2`` welcomes contributions from anyone!

The target are\\nsmall apps that would be blown away by a SQL-DB or an external database server.\\n\\nTinyDB is:\\n\\n- **tiny:** The current source code has 1800 lines of code (with about 40%\\n  documentation) and 1600 lines tests.\\n\\n- **document oriented:** Like MongoDB_, you can store any document\\n  (represented as ``dict``) in TinyDB.\\n\\n- **optimized for your happiness:** TinyDB is designed to be simple and\\n  fun to use by providing a simple and clean API.\\n\\n- **written in pure Python:** TinyDB neither needs an external server (as\\n  e.g. `PyMongo <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_) nor any dependencies\\n  from PyPI.\\n\\n- **works on Python 3.8+ and PyPy3:** TinyDB works on all modern versions of Python\\n  and PyPy.\\n\\n- **powerfully extensible:** You can easily extend TinyDB by writing new\\n  storages or modify the behaviour of storages with Middlewares.\\n\\n- **100% test coverage:** No explanation needed.\\n\\nTo dive straight into all the details, head over to the `TinyDB docs\\n<https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/>`_. You can also discuss everything related\\nto TinyDB like general development, extensions or showcase your TinyDB-based\\nprojects on the `discussion forum <http://forum.m-siemens.de/.>`_.\\n\\nSupported Python Versions\\n*************************\\n\\nTinyDB has been tested with Python 3.8 - 3.13 and PyPy3.\\n\\nProject Status\\n**************\\n\\nThis project is in maintenance mode. It has reached a mature, stable state\\nwhere significant new features or architectural changes are not planned. That\\nsaid, there will still be releases for bugfixes or features contributed by\\nthe community. Read more about what this means in particular\\n`here <https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb/discussions/572>`_.\\n\\nExample Code\\n************\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from tinydb import TinyDB, Query\\n    >>> db = TinyDB('/path/to/db.json')\\n    >>> db.insert({'int': 1, 'char': 'a'})\\n    >>> db.insert({'int': 1, 'char': 'b'})\\n\\nQuery Language\\n==============\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> User = Query()\\n    >>> # Search for a field value\\n    >>> db.search(User.name == 'John')\\n    [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'John', 'age': 37}]\\n\\n    >>> # Combine two queries with logical and\\n    >>> db.search((User.name == 'John') & (User.age <= 30))\\n    [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}]\\n\\n    >>> # Combine two queries with logical or\\n    >>> db.search((User.name == 'John') | (User.name == 'Bob'))\\n    [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'John', 'age': 37}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 42}]\\n\\n    >>> # Negate a query with logical not\\n    >>> db.search(~(User.name == 'John'))\\n    [{'name': 'Megan', 'age': 27}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 42}]\\n\\n    >>> # Apply transformation to field with `map`\\n    >>> db.search((User.age.map(lambda x: x + x) == 44))\\n    >>> [{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}]\\n\\n    >>> # More possible comparisons:  !=  <  >  <=  >=\\n    >>> # More possible checks: where(...).matches(regex), where(...).test(your_test_func)\\n\\nTables\\n======\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> table = db.table('name')\\n    >>> table.insert({'value': True})\\n    >>> table.all()\\n    [{'value': True}]\\n\\nUsing Middlewares\\n=================\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from tinydb.storages import JSONStorage\\n    >>> from tinydb.middlewares import CachingMiddleware\\n    >>> db = TinyDB('/path/to/db.json', storage=CachingMiddleware(JSONStorage))\\n\\n\\nContributing\\n************\\n\\nWhether reporting bugs, discussing improvements and new ideas or writing\\nextensions: Contributions to TinyDB are welcome! Here's how to get started:\\n\\n1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around\\n   a feature idea or a bug\\n2. Fork `the repository <https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb/>`_ on Github,\\n   create a new branch off the `master` branch and start making your changes\\n   (known as `GitHub Flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_)\\n3. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works\\n   as expected\\n4. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and\\n   published ☺\\n\\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/azure-devops/build/msiemens/3e5baa75-12ec-43ac-9728-89823ee8c7e2/2.svg?style=flat-square\\n   :target: https://dev.azure.com/msiemens/github/_build?definitionId=2\\n.. |Coverage| image:: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/msiemens/tinydb.svg?style=flat-square\\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/msiemens/tinydb\\n.. |Version| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tinydb.svg?style=flat-square\\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinydb/\\n.. _Buzhug: http://buzhug.sourceforge.net/\\n.. _CodernityDB: https://github.com/perchouli/codernitydb\\n.. _MongoDB: http://mongodb.org/\\n\\n\",\n",

Only one instance of the class is created for each filename. Subclassing it to add more attributes on creation or methods is recommended. The classmethods such as `executing` will respect this. See the source code and docstrings for more detail.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n    pip install executing\\n\\nIf you don't like that you can just copy the file `executing.py`, there are no dependencies (but of course you won't get updates).\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nSuppose the frame is executing this line:\\n\\n```python\\nself.foo(bar.x)\\n```\\n\\nand in particular it's currently obtaining the attribute `self.foo`. Looking at the bytecode, specifically `frame.f_code.co_code[frame.f_lasti]`, we can tell that it's loading an attribute, but it's not obvious which one. We can narrow down the statement being executed using `frame.f_lineno` and find the two `ast.Attribute` nodes representing `self.foo` and `bar.x`. How do we find out which one it is, without recreating the entire compiler in Python?\\n\\nThe trick is to modify the AST slightly for each candidate expression and observe the changes in the bytecode instructions. We change the AST to this:\\n\\n```python\\n(self.foo ** 'longuniqueconstant')(bar.x)\\n```\\n    \\nand compile it, and the bytecode will be almost the same but there will be two new instructions:\\n\\n    LOAD_CONST 'longuniqueconstant'\\n    BINARY_POWER\\n\\nand just before that will be a `LOAD_ATTR` instruction corresponding to `self.foo`. Seeing that it's in the same position as the original instruction lets us know we've found our match.\\n\\n## Is it reliable?\\n\\nYes - if it identifies a node, you can trust that it's identified the correct one. The tests are very thorough - in addition to unit tests which check various situations directly, there are property tests against a large number of files (see the filenames printed in [this build](https://travis-ci.org/alexmojaki/executing/jobs/557970457)) with real code. Specifically, for each file, the tests:\\n \\n 1. Identify as many nodes as possible from all the bytecode instructions in the file, and assert that they are all distinct\\n 2. Find all the nodes that should be identifiable, and assert that they were indeed identified somewhere\\n\\nIn other words, it shows that there is a one-to-one mapping between the nodes and the instructions that can be handled. This leaves very little room for a bug to creep in.\\n\\nFurthermore, `executing` checks that the instructions compiled from the modified AST exactly match the original code save for a few small known exceptions. This accounts for all the quirks and optimisations in the interpreter. \\n\\n## Which nodes can it identify?\\n\\nCurrently it works in almost all cases for the following `ast` nodes:\\n \\n - `Call`, e.g. `self.foo(bar)`\\n - `Attribute`, e.g. `point.x`\\n - `Subscript`, e.g. `lst[1]`\\n - `BinOp`, e.g. `x + y` (doesn't include `and` and `or`)\\n - `UnaryOp`, e.g. `-n` (includes `not` but only works sometimes)\\n - `Compare` e.g. `a < b` (not for chains such as `0 < p < 1`)\\n\\nThe plan is to extend to more operations in the future.\\n\\n## Projects that use this\\n\\n### My Projects\\n\\n- **[`stack_data`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/stack_data)**: Extracts data from stack frames and tracebacks, particularly to display more useful tracebacks than the default. Also uses another related library of mine: **[`pure_eval`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/pure_eval)**.\\n- **[`futurecoder`](https://futurecoder.io/)**: Highlights the executing node in tracebacks using `executing` via `stack_data`, and provides debugging with `snoop`.\\n- **[`snoop`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop)**: A feature-rich and convenient debugging library. Uses `executing` to show the operation which caused an exception and to allow the `pp` function to display the source of its arguments.\\n- **[`heartrate`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/heartrate)**: A simple real time visualisation of the execution of a Python program. Uses `executing` to highlight currently executing operations, particularly in each frame of the stack trace.\\n- **[`sorcery`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/sorcery)**: Dark magic delights in Python. Uses `executing` to let special callables called spells know where they're being called from.\\n\\n### Projects I've contributed to\\n\\n- **[`IPython`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12150)**: Highlights the executing node in tracebacks using `executing` via [`stack_data`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/stack_data).\\n- **[`icecream`](https://github.com/gruns/icecream)**: 🍦 Sweet and creamy print debugging. Uses `executing` to identify where `ic` is called and print its arguments.\\n- **[`friendly_traceback`](https://github.com/friendly-traceback/friendly-traceback)**: Uses `stack_data` and `executing` to pinpoint the cause of errors and provide helpful explanations.\\n- **[`python-devtools`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/python-devtools)**: Uses `executing` for print debugging similar to `icecream`.\\n- **[`sentry_sdk`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python)**: Add the integration `sentry_sdk.integrations.executingExecutingIntegration()` to show the function `__qualname__` in each frame in sentry events.\\n- **[`varname`](https://github.com/pwwang/python-varname)**: Dark magics about variable names in python.

It powers the tracebacks in IPython and [futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io/):\\n\\n![futurecoder example](https://futurecoder.io/static/img/features/traceback.png)\\n\\nYou can install it from PyPI:\\n\\n    pip install stack_data\\n    \\n## Basic usage\\n\\nHere's some code we'd like to inspect:\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo():\\n    result = []\\n    for i in range(5):\\n        row = []\\n        result.append(row)\\n        print_stack()\\n        for j in range(5):\\n            row.append(i * j)\\n    return result\\n```\\n\\nNote that `foo` calls a function `print_stack()`. In reality we can imagine that an exception was raised at this line, or a debugger stopped there, but this is easy to play with directly. Here's a basic implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport inspect\\nimport stack_data\\n\\n\\ndef print_stack():\\n    frame = inspect.currentframe().f_back\\n    frame_info = stack_data.FrameInfo(frame)\\n    print(f\\\"{frame_info.code.co_name} at line {frame_info.lineno}\\\")\\n    print(\\\"-----------\\\")\\n    for line in frame_info.lines:\\n        print(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render()}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n(Beware that this has a major bug - it doesn't account for line gaps, which we'll learn about later)\\n\\nThe output of one call to `print_stack()` looks like:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 9\\n-----------\\n       6 | for i in range(5):\\n       7 |     row = []\\n       8 |     result.append(row)\\n-->    9 |     print_stack()\\n      10 |     for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nThe code for `print_stack()` is fairly self-explanatory. If you want to learn more details about a particular class or method I suggest looking through some docstrings. `FrameInfo` is a class that accepts either a frame or a traceback object and provides a bunch of nice attributes and properties (which are cached so you don't need to worry about performance). In particular `frame_info.lines` is a list of `Line` objects. `line.render()` returns the source code of that line suitable for display. Without any arguments it simply strips any common leading indentation. Later on we'll see a more powerful use for it.\\n\\nYou can see that `frame_info.lines` includes some lines of surrounding context. By default it includes 3 pieces of context before the main line and 1 piece after. We can configure the amount of context by passing options:\\n\\n```python\\noptions = stack_data.Options(before=1, after=0)\\nframe_info = stack_data.FrameInfo(frame, options)\\n```\\n\\nThen the output looks like:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 9\\n-----------\\n       8 | result.append(row)\\n-->    9 | print_stack()\\n```\\n\\nNote that these parameters are not the number of *lines* before and after to include, but the number of *pieces*. A piece is a range of one or more lines in a file that should logically be grouped together. A piece contains either a single simple statement or a part of a compound statement (loops, if, try/except, etc) that doesn't contain any other statements. Most pieces are a single line, but a multi-line statement or `if` condition is a single piece. In the example above, all pieces are one line, because nothing is spread across multiple lines. If we change our code to include some multiline bits:\\n\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo():\\n    result = []\\n    for i in range(5):\\n        row = []\\n        result.append(\\n            row\\n        )\\n        print_stack()\\n        for j in range(\\n                5\\n        ):\\n            row.append(i * j)\\n    return result\\n```\\n\\nand then run the original code with the default options, then the output is:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 11\\n-----------\\n       6 | for i in range(5):\\n       7 |     row = []\\n       8 |     result.append(\\n       9 |         row\\n      10 |     )\\n-->   11 |     print_stack()\\n      12 |     for j in range(\\n      13 |             5\\n      14 |     ):\\n```\\n\\nNow lines 8-10 and lines 12-14 are each a single piece. Note that the output is essentially the same as the original in terms of the amount of code. The division of files into pieces means that the edge of the context is intuitive and doesn't crop out parts of statements or expressions. For example, if context was measured in lines instead of pieces, the last line of the above would be `for j in range(` which is much less useful.\\n\\nHowever, if a piece is very long, including all of it could be cumbersome. For this, `Options` has a parameter `max_lines_per_piece`, which is 6 by default. Suppose we have a piece in our code that's longer than that:\\n\\n```python\\n        row = [\\n            1,\\n            2,\\n            3,\\n            4,\\n            5,\\n        ]\\n```\\n\\n`frame_info.lines` will truncate this piece so that instead of 7 `Line` objects it will produce 5 `Line` objects and one `LINE_GAP` in the middle, making 6 objects in total for the piece. Our code doesn't currently handle gaps, so it will raise an exception. We can modify it like so:\\n\\n```python\\n    for line in frame_info.lines:\\n        if line is stack_data.LINE_GAP:\\n            print(\\\"       (...)\\\")\\n        else:\\n            print(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render()}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNow the output looks like:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 15\\n-----------\\n       6 | for i in range(5):\\n       7 |     row = [\\n       8 |         1,\\n       9 |         2,\\n       (...)\\n      12 |         5,\\n      13 |     ]\\n      14 |     result.append(row)\\n-->   15 |     print_stack()\\n      16 |     for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can flip the condition around and check `if isinstance(line, stack_data.Line):`. Either way, you should always check for line gaps, or your code may appear to work at first but fail when it encounters a long piece.\\n\\nNote that the executing piece, i.e. the piece containing the current line being executed (line 15 in this case) is never truncated, no matter how long it is.\\n\\nThe lines of context never stray outside `frame_info.scope`, which is the innermost function or class definition containing the current line. For example, this is the output for a short function which has neither 3 lines before nor 1 line after the current line:\\n\\n```\\nbar at line 6\\n-----------\\n       4 | def bar():\\n       5 |     foo()\\n-->    6 |     print_stack()\\n```\\n\\nSometimes it's nice to ensure that the function signature is always showing. This can be done with `Options(include_signature=True)`. The result looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 14\\n-----------\\n       9 | def foo():\\n       (...)\\n      11 |     for i in range(5):\\n      12 |         row = []\\n      13 |         result.append(row)\\n-->   14 |         print_stack()\\n      15 |         for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nTo avoid wasting space, pieces never start or end with a blank line, and blank lines between pieces are excluded. So if our code looks like this:\\n\\n\\n```python\\n    for i in range(5):\\n        row = []\\n\\n        result.append(row)\\n        print_stack()\\n\\n        for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nThe output doesn't change much, except you can see jumps in the line numbers:\\n\\n```\\n      11 |     for i in range(5):\\n      12 |         row = []\\n      14 |         result.append(row)\\n-->   15 |         print_stack()\\n      17 |         for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\n## Variables\\n\\nYou can also inspect variables and other expressions in a frame, e.g:\\n\\n```python\\n    for var in frame_info.variables:\\n        print(f\\\"{var.name} = {repr(var.value)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nwhich may output:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], [0, 3, 6, 9, 12], []]\\ni = 4\\nrow = []\\nj = 4\\n```\\n\\n`frame_info.variables` returns a list of `Variable` objects, which have attributes `name`, `value`, and `nodes`, which is a list of all AST representing that expression.\\n\\nA `Variable` may refer to an expression other than a simple variable name. It can be any expression evaluated by the library [`pure_eval`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/pure_eval) which it deems 'interesting' (see those docs for more info). This includes expressions like `foo.bar` or `foo[bar]`. In these cases `name` is the source code of that expression. `pure_eval` ensures that it only evaluates expressions that won't have any side effects, e.g. where `foo.bar` is a normal attribute rather than a descriptor such as a property.\\n\\n`frame_info.variables` is a list of all the interesting expressions found in `frame_info.scope`, e.g. the current function, which may include expressions not visible in `frame_info.lines`. You can restrict the list by using `frame_info.variables_in_lines` or even `frame_info.variables_in_executing_piece`. For more control you can use `frame_info.variables_by_lineno`. See the docstrings for more information.\\n\\n## Rendering lines with ranges and markers\\n\\nSometimes you may want to insert special characters into the text for display purposes, e.g. HTML or ANSI color codes. `stack_data` provides a few tools to make this easier.\\n\\nLet's say we have a `Line` object where `line.text` (the original raw source code of that line) is `\\\"foo = bar\\\"`, so `line.text[6:9]` is `\\\"bar\\\"`, and we want to emphasise that part by inserting HTML at positions 6 and 9 in the text. Here's how we can do that directly:\\n\\n```python\\nmarkers = [\\n    stack_data.MarkerInLine(position=6, is_start=True, string=\\\"<b>\\\"),\\n    stack_data.MarkerInLine(position=9, is_start=False, string=\\\"</b>\\\"),\\n]\\nline.render(markers)  # returns \\\"foo = <b>bar</b>\\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere `is_start=True` indicates that the marker is the first of a pair. This helps `line.render()` sort and insert the markers correctly so you don't end up with malformed HTML like `foo<b>.<i></b>bar</i>` where tags overlap.\\n\\nSince we're inserting HTML, we should actually use `line.render(markers, escape_html=True)` which will escape special HTML characters in the Python source (but not the markers) so for example `foo = bar < spam` would be rendered as `foo = <b>bar</b> &lt; spam`.\\n\\nUsually though you wouldn't create markers directly yourself. Instead you would start with one or more ranges and then convert them, like so:\\n\\n```python\\nranges = [\\n    stack_data.RangeInLine(start=0, end=3, data=\\\"foo\\\"),\\n    stack_data.RangeInLine(start=6, end=9, data=\\\"bar\\\"),\\n]\\n\\ndef convert_ranges(r):\\n    if r.data == \\\"bar\\\":\\n        return \\\"<b>\\\", \\\"</b>\\\"        \\n\\n# This results in `markers` being the same as in the above example.\\nmarkers = stack_data.markers_from_ranges(ranges, convert_ranges)\\n```\\n\\n`RangeInLine` has a `data` attribute which can be any object. `markers_from_ranges` accepts a converter function to which it passes all the `RangeInLine` objects. If the converter function returns a pair of strings, it creates two markers from them. Otherwise it should return `None` to indicate that the range should be ignored, as with the first range containing `\\\"foo\\\"` in this example.\\n\\nThe reason this is useful is because there are built in tools to create these ranges for you. For example, if we change our `print_stack()` function to contain this:\\n\\n```python\\ndef convert_variable_ranges(r):\\n    variable, _node = r.data\\n    return f'<span data-value=\\\"{repr(variable.value)}\\\">', '</span>'\\n\\nmarkers = stack_data.markers_from_ranges(line.variable_ranges, convert_variable_ranges)\\nprint(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render(markers, escape_html=True)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nThen the output becomes:\\n\\n```\\nfoo at line 15\\n-----------\\n       9 | def foo():\\n       (...)\\n      11 |     for <span data-value=\\\"4\\\">i</span> in range(5):\\n      12 |         <span data-value=\\\"[]\\\">row</span> = []\\n      14 |         <span data-value=\\\"[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], [0, 3, 6, 9, 12], []]\\\">result</span>.append(<span data-value=\\\"[]\\\">row</span>)\\n-->   15 |         print_stack()\\n      17 |         for <span data-value=\\\"4\\\">j</span> in range(5):\\n```\\n\\n`line.variable_ranges` is a list of RangeInLines for each Variable that appears at least partially in this line. The data attribute of the range is a pair `(variable, node)` where node is the particular AST node from the list `variable.nodes` that corresponds to this range.\\n\\nYou can also use `line.token_ranges` (e.g. if you want to do your own syntax highlighting) or `line.executing_node_ranges` if you want to highlight the currently executing node identified by the [`executing`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing) library. Or if you want to make your own range from an AST node, use `line.range_from_node(node, data)`. See the docstrings for more info.\\n\\n### Syntax highlighting with Pygments\\n\\nIf you'd like pretty colored text without the work, you can let [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) do it for you. Just follow these steps:\\n\\n1. `pip install pygments` separately as it's not a dependency of `stack_data`.\\n2. Create a pygments formatter object such as `HtmlFormatter` or `Terminal256Formatter`.\\n3. Pass the formatter to `Options` in the argument `pygments_formatter`.\\n4. Use `line.render(pygmented=True)` to get your formatted text. In this case you can't pass any markers to `render`.\\n\\nIf you want, you can also highlight the executing node in the frame in combination with the pygments syntax highlighting. For this you will need:\\n\\n1. A pygments style - either a style class or a string that names it. See the [documentation on styles](https://pygments.org/docs/styles/) and the [styles gallery](https://blog.yjl.im/2015/08/pygments-styles-gallery.html).\\n2. A modification to make to the style for the executing node, which is a string such as `\\\"bold\\\"` or `\\\"bg:#ffff00\\\"` (yellow background). See the [documentation on style rules](https://pygments.org/docs/styles/#style-rules).\\n3. Pass these two things to `stack_data.style_with_executing_node(style, modifier)` to get a new style class.\\n4. Pass the new style to your formatter when you create it.\\n\\nNote that this doesn't work with `TerminalFormatter` which just uses the basic ANSI colors and doesn't use the style passed to it in general.\\n\\n## Getting the full stack\\n\\nCurrently `print_stack()` doesn't actually print the stack, it just prints one frame. Instead of `frame_info = FrameInfo(frame, options)`, let's do this:\\n\\n```python\\nfor frame_info in FrameInfo.stack_data(frame, options):\\n```\\n\\nNow the output looks something like this:\\n\\n```\\n<module> at line 18\\n-----------\\n      14 |         for j in range(5):\\n      15 |             row.append(i * j)\\n      16 |     return result\\n-->   18 | bar()\\n\\nbar at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def bar():\\n-->    5 |     foo()\\n\\nfoo at line 13\\n-----------\\n      10 | for i in range(5):\\n      11 |     row = []\\n      12 |     result.append(row)\\n-->   13 |     print_stack()\\n      14 |     for j in range(5):\\n```\\n\\nHowever, just as `frame_info.lines` doesn't always yield `Line` objects, `FrameInfo.stack_data` doesn't always yield `FrameInfo` objects, and we must modify our code to handle that. Let's look at some different sample code:\\n\\n```python\\ndef factorial(x):\\n    return x * factorial(x - 1)\\n\\n\\ntry:\\n    print(factorial(5))\\nexcept:\\n    print_stack()\\n```\\n\\nIn this code we've forgotten to include a base case in our `factorial` function so it will fail with a `RecursionError` and there'll be many frames with similar information. Similar to the built in Python traceback, `stack_data` avoids showing all of these frames. Instead you will get a `RepeatedFrames` object which summarises the information. See its docstring for more details.\\n\\nHere is our updated implementation:\\n\\n```python\\ndef print_stack():\\n    for frame_info in FrameInfo.stack_data(sys.exc_info()[2]):\\n        if isinstance(frame_info, FrameInfo):\\n            print(f\\\"{frame_info.code.co_name} at line {frame_info.lineno}\\\")\\n            print(\\\"-----------\\\")\\n            for line in frame_info.lines:\\n                print(f\\\"{'-->' if line.is_current else '   '} {line.lineno:4} | {line.render()}\\\")\\n\\n            for var in frame_info.variables:\\n                print(f\\\"{var.name} = {repr(var.value)}\\\")\\n\\n            print()\\n        else:\\n            print(f\\\"... {frame_info.description} ...\\\\n\\\")\\n```\\n\\nAnd the output:\\n\\n```\\n<module> at line 9\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n       5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\n       8 | try:\\n-->    9 |     print(factorial(5))\\n      10 | except:\\n\\nfactorial at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n-->    5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\nx = 5\\n\\nfactorial at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n-->    5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\nx = 4\\n\\n... factorial at line 5 (996 times) ...\\n\\nfactorial at line 5\\n-----------\\n       4 | def factorial(x):\\n-->    5 |     return x * factorial(x - 1)\\nx = -993\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to handling repeated frames, we've passed a traceback object to `FrameInfo.stack_data` instead of a frame.\\n\\nIf you want, you can pass `collapse_repeated_frames=False` to `FrameInfo.stack_data` (not to `Options`) and it will just yield `FrameInfo` objects for the full stack.\\n\",\n",

Every time you stay there the\\nprice goes up by $50!\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @property\\n        def boardwalk(self):\\n            # In reality, this might represent a database call or time\\n            # intensive task like calling a third-party API.\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow run it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    600\\n\\nLet's convert the boardwalk property into a ``cached_property``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from cached_property import cached_property\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @cached_property\\n        def boardwalk(self):\\n            # Again, this is a silly example. Don't worry about it, this is\\n            #   just an example for clarity.\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow when we run it the price stays at $550.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n\\nWhy doesn't the value of ``monopoly.boardwalk`` change? Because it's a **cached property**!\\n\\nInvalidating the Cache\\n----------------------\\n\\nResults of cached functions can be invalidated by outside forces. Let's demonstrate how to force the cache to invalidate:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    550\\n    >>> # invalidate the cache\\n    >>> del monopoly.__dict__['boardwalk']\\n    >>> # request the boardwalk property again\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    600\\n    >>> monopoly.boardwalk\\n    600\\n\\nWorking with Threads\\n---------------------\\n\\nWhat if a whole bunch of people want to stay at Boardwalk all at once? This means using threads, which\\nunfortunately causes problems with the standard ``cached_property``. In this case, switch to using the\\n``threaded_cached_property``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from cached_property import threaded_cached_property\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @threaded_cached_property\\n        def boardwalk(self):\\n            \\\"\\\"\\\"threaded_cached_property is really nice for when no one waits\\n                for other people to finish their turn and rudely start rolling\\n                dice and moving their pieces.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n            sleep(1)\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow use it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> from threading import Thread\\n    >>> from monopoly import Monopoly\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> threads = []\\n    >>> for x in range(10):\\n    >>>     thread = Thread(target=lambda: monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    >>>     thread.start()\\n    >>>     threads.append(thread)\\n\\n    >>> for thread in threads:\\n    >>>     thread.join()\\n\\n    >>> self.assertEqual(m.boardwalk, 550)\\n\\n\\nWorking with async/await (Python 3.5+)\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nThe cached property can be async, in which case you have to use await\\nas usual to get the value. Because of the caching, the value is only\\ncomputed once and then cached:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from cached_property import cached_property\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        def __init__(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price = 500\\n\\n        @cached_property\\n        async def boardwalk(self):\\n            self.boardwalk_price += 50\\n            return self.boardwalk_price\\n\\nNow use it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> async def print_boardwalk():\\n    ...     monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    ...     print(await monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    ...     print(await monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    ...     print(await monopoly.boardwalk)\\n    >>> import asyncio\\n    >>> asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(print_boardwalk())\\n    550\\n    550\\n    550\\n\\nNote that this does not work with threading either, most asyncio\\nobjects are not thread-safe. And if you run separate event loops in\\neach thread, the cached version will most likely have the wrong event\\nloop. To summarize, either use cooperative multitasking (event loop)\\nor threading, but not both at the same time.\\n\\n\\nTiming out the cache\\n--------------------\\n\\nSometimes you want the price of things to reset after a time. Use the ``ttl``\\nversions of ``cached_property`` and ``threaded_cached_property``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    import random\\n    from cached_property import cached_property_with_ttl\\n\\n    class Monopoly(object):\\n\\n        @cached_property_with_ttl(ttl=5) # cache invalidates after 5 seconds\\n        def dice(self):\\n            # I dare the reader to implement a game using this method of 'rolling dice'.\\n            return random.randint(2,12)\\n\\nNow use it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> monopoly = Monopoly()\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    10\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    10\\n    >>> from time import sleep\\n    >>> sleep(6) # Sleeps long enough to expire the cache\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    3\\n    >>> monopoly.dice\\n    3\\n\\n**Note:** The ``ttl`` tools do not reliably allow the clearing of the cache. This\\nis why they are broken out into seperate tools.

The nbconvert tool allows you to convert an\\n`.ipynb` notebook file into various static formats including:\\n\\n- HTML\\n- LaTeX\\n- PDF\\n- Reveal JS\\n- Markdown (md)\\n- ReStructured Text (rst)\\n- executable script\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nFrom the command line, use nbconvert to convert a Jupyter notebook (_input_) to a\\na different format (_output_). The basic command structure is:\\n\\n```\\n$ jupyter nbconvert --to <output format> <input notebook>\\n```\\n\\nwhere `<output format>` is the desired output format and `<input notebook>` is the\\nfilename of the Jupyter notebook.\\n\\n### Example: Convert a notebook to HTML\\n\\nConvert Jupyter notebook file, `mynotebook.ipynb`, to HTML using:\\n\\n```\\n$ jupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb\\n```\\n\\nThis command creates an HTML output file named `mynotebook.html`.\\n\\n## Dev Install\\n\\nCheck if pandoc is installed (`pandoc --version`); if needed, install:\\n\\n```\\nsudo apt-get install pandoc\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```\\nbrew install pandoc\\n```\\n\\nInstall nbconvert for development using:\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert.git\\ncd nbconvert\\npip install -e .\\n```\\n\\nRunning the tests after a dev install above:\\n\\n```\\npip install nbconvert[test]\\npy.test --pyargs nbconvert\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n- [Documentation for Jupyter nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\\n- [nbconvert examples on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert-examples)\\n- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\\n\\n## Technical Support\\n\\n- [Issues and Bug Reports](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues): A place to report\\n  bugs or regressions found for nbconvert\\n- [Community Technical Support and Discussion - Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/): A place for\\n  installation, configuration, and troubleshooting assistannce by the Jupyter community.\\n  As a non-profit project and maintainers who are primarily volunteers, we encourage you\\n  to ask questions and share your knowledge on Discourse.\\n\\n## Jupyter Resources\\n\\n- [Jupyter mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter)\\n- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\\n\\n## About the Jupyter Development Team\\n\\nThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.\\nThis includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.\\n\\nThe core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:\\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/.\\n\\n## Our Copyright Policy\\n\\nJupyter uses a shared copyright model.

On OS X, it uses native ``FSMoveObjectToTrashSync`` Cocoa calls or can use pyobjc \\nwith NSFileManager. On Windows, it uses native ``IFileOperation`` call if on Vista or newer and \\npywin32 is installed or falls back to ``SHFileOperation`` calls. On other platforms, if `PyGObject`_ \\nand `GIO`_ are available, it will use this.  Otherwise, it will fallback to its own implementation of \\nthe `trash specifications from freedesktop.org`_.\\n\\n``ctypes`` is used to access native libraries, so no compilation is necessary.\\n\\nSend2Trash supports Python 2.7 and up (Python 3 is supported).\\n\\nStatus: Additional Help Welcome\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nAdditional help is welcome for supporting this package.  Specifically help with the OSX and Linux \\nissues and fixes would be most appreciated.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nYou can download it with pip:\\n\\n    python -m pip install -U send2trash\\n\\nTo install with pywin32 or pyobjc required specify the extra `nativeLib`:\\n\\n    python -m pip install -U send2trash[nativeLib]\\n\\nor you can download the source from http://github.com/arsenetar/send2trash and install it with::\\n\\n    >>> python setup.py install\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\n>>> from send2trash import send2trash\\n>>> send2trash('some_file')\\n>>> send2trash(['some_file1', 'some_file2'])\\n\\nOn Freedesktop platforms (Linux, BSD, etc.), you may not be able to efficiently\\ntrash some files. In these cases, an exception ``send2trash.TrashPermissionError``\\nis raised, so that the application can handle this case. This inherits from\\n``PermissionError`` (``OSError`` on Python 2). Specifically, this affects\\nfiles on a different device to the user's home directory, where the root of the\\ndevice does not have a ``.Trash`` directory, and we don't have permission to\\ncreate a ``.Trash-$UID`` directory.\\n\\nFor any other problem, ``OSError`` is raised.\\n\\n.. _PyGObject: https://wiki.gnome.org/PyGObject\\n.. _GIO: https://developer.gnome.org/gio/\\n.. _trash specifications from freedesktop.org: http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec/\\n\",\n",

Due to its modular design, you can extend (or even rewrite!)\\nthe complete list without changing the source code. It supports a lot of\\nnumpy mathematical operations **without monkey patching or wrapping numpy**.\\n\\nIt has a complete test coverage. It runs in Python 3.9+ with no other dependency.\\nIt is licensed under BSD.\\n\\nIt is extremely easy and natural to use:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import pint\\n    >>> ureg = pint.UnitRegistry()\\n    >>> 3 * ureg.meter + 4 * ureg.cm\\n    <Quantity(3.04, 'meter')>\\n\\nand you can make good use of numpy if you want:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> [3, 4] * ureg.meter + [4, 3] * ureg.cm\\n    <Quantity([ 3.04  4.03], 'meter')>\\n    >>> np.sum(_)\\n    <Quantity(7.07, 'meter')>\\n\\n\\nQuick Installation\\n------------------\\n\\nTo install Pint, simply:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ pip install pint\\n\\nor utilizing conda, with the conda-forge channel:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge pint\\n\\nand then simply enjoy it!\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nFull documentation is available at http://pint.readthedocs.org/\\n\\n\\nCommand-line converter\\n----------------------\\n\\nA command-line script `pint-convert` provides a quick way to convert between\\nunits or get conversion factors.\\n\\n\\nDesign principles\\n-----------------\\n\\nAlthough there are already a few very good Python packages to handle physical\\nquantities, no one was really fitting my needs. Like most developers, I\\nprogrammed Pint to scratch my own itches.\\n\\n**Unit parsing**: prefixed and pluralized forms of units are recognized without\\nexplicitly defining them. In other words: as the prefix *kilo* and the unit\\n*meter* are defined, Pint understands *kilometers*. This results in a much\\nshorter and maintainable unit definition list as compared to other packages.\\n\\n**Standalone unit definitions**: units definitions are loaded from a text file\\nwhich is simple and easy to edit. Adding and changing units and their\\ndefinitions does not involve changing the code.\\n\\n**Advanced string formatting**: a quantity can be formatted into string using\\n`PEP 3101`_ syntax. Extended conversion flags are given to provide symbolic,\\nLaTeX and pretty formatting. Unit name translation is available if Babel_ is\\ninstalled.\\n\\n**Free to choose the numerical type**: You can use any numerical type\\n(`fraction`, `float`, `decimal`, `numpy.ndarray`, etc). NumPy_ is not required\\nbut supported.\\n\\n**Awesome NumPy integration**: When you choose to use a NumPy_ ndarray, its methods and\\nufuncs are supported including automatic conversion of units. For example\\n`numpy.arccos(q)` will require a dimensionless `q` and the units of the output\\nquantity will be radian.\\n\\n**Uncertainties integration**:  transparently handles calculations with\\nquantities with uncertainties (like 3.14±0.01 meter) via the `uncertainties\\npackage`_.\\n\\n**Handle temperature**: conversion between units with different reference\\npoints, like positions on a map or absolute temperature scales.\\n\\n**Dependency free**: it depends only on Python and its standard library. It interacts with other packages\\nlike numpy and uncertainties if they are installed\\n\\n**Pandas integration**: Thanks to `Pandas Extension Types`_ it is now possible to use Pint with Pandas. Operations on DataFrames and between columns are units aware, providing even more convenience for users of Pandas DataFrames. For full details, see the `pint-pandas Jupyter notebook`_.\\n\\n\\nPint is maintained by a community of scientists, programmers and enthusiasts around the world.\\nSee AUTHORS_ for a complete list.\\n\\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\\nsee CHANGES_\\n\\n\\n.. _Website: http://www.dimensionalanalysis.org/\\n.. _`comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes and constants`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt\\n.. _`uncertainties package`: https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\\n.. _`NumPy`: http://www.numpy.org/\\n.. _`PEP 3101`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/\\n.. _`Babel`: http://babel.pocoo.org/\\n.. _`Pandas Extension Types`: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html#extension-types\\n.. _`pint-pandas Jupyter notebook`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint-pandas/blob/master/notebooks/pint-pandas.ipynb\\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/AUTHORS\\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/CHANGES\\n\",\n",

This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network\\nAPI, and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded,\\nasynchronous, or your own implementation of `RFC 6214\\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6214>`_ -- h11 won't judge you.\\n(Compare this to the current state of the art, where every time a `new\\nnetwork API <https://trio.readthedocs.io/>`_ comes along then someone\\ngets to start over reimplementing the entire HTTP protocol from\\nscratch.) Cory Benfield made an `excellent blog post describing the\\nbenefits of this approach\\n<https://lukasa.co.uk/2015/10/The_New_Hyper/>`_, or if you like video\\nthen here's his `PyCon 2016 talk on the same theme\\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cC3_jGwl_U>`_.\\n\\nThis also means that h11 is not immediately useful out of the box:\\nit's a toolkit for building programs that speak HTTP, not something\\nthat could directly replace ``requests`` or ``twisted.web`` or\\nwhatever. But h11 makes it much easier to implement something like\\n``requests`` or ``twisted.web``.\\n\\nAt a high level, working with h11 goes like this:\\n\\n1) First, create an ``h11.Connection`` object to track the state of a\\n   single HTTP/1.1 connection.\\n\\n2) When you read data off the network, pass it to\\n   ``conn.receive_data(...)``; you'll get back a list of objects\\n   representing high-level HTTP \\\"events\\\".\\n\\n3) When you want to send a high-level HTTP event, create the\\n   corresponding \\\"event\\\" object and pass it to ``conn.send(...)``;\\n   this will give you back some bytes that you can then push out\\n   through the network.\\n\\nFor example, a client might instantiate and then send a\\n``h11.Request`` object, then zero or more ``h11.Data`` objects for the\\nrequest body (e.g., if this is a POST), and then a\\n``h11.EndOfMessage`` to indicate the end of the message. Then the\\nserver would then send back a ``h11.Response``, some ``h11.Data``, and\\nits own ``h11.EndOfMessage``. If either side violates the protocol,\\nyou'll get a ``h11.ProtocolError`` exception.\\n\\nh11 is suitable for implementing both servers and clients, and has a\\npleasantly symmetric API: the events you send as a client are exactly\\nthe ones that you receive as a server and vice-versa.\\n\\n`Here's an example of a tiny HTTP client\\n<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/examples/basic-client.py>`_\\n\\nIt also has `a fine manual <https://h11.readthedocs.io/>`_.\\n\\nFAQ\\n---\\n\\n*Whyyyyy?*\\n\\nI wanted to play with HTTP in `Curio\\n<https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`__ and `Trio\\n<https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__, which at the time didn't have any\\nHTTP libraries. So I thought, no big deal, Python has, like, a dozen\\ndifferent implementations of HTTP, surely I can find one that's\\nreusable. I didn't find one, but I did find Cory's call-to-arms\\nblog-post. So I figured, well, fine, if I have to implement HTTP from\\nscratch, at least I can make sure no-one *else* has to ever again.\\n\\n*Should I use it?*\\n\\nMaybe. You should be aware that it's a very young project. But, it's\\nfeature complete and has an exhaustive test-suite and complete docs,\\nso the next step is for people to try using it and see how it goes\\n:-). If you do then please let us know -- if nothing else we'll want\\nto talk to you before making any incompatible changes!\\n\\n*What are the features/limitations?*\\n\\nRoughly speaking, it's trying to be a robust, complete, and non-hacky\\nimplementation of the first \\\"chapter\\\" of the HTTP/1.1 spec: `RFC 7230:\\nHTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing\\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230>`_. That is, it mostly focuses on\\nimplementing HTTP at the level of taking bytes on and off the wire,\\nand the headers related to that, and tries to be anal about spec\\nconformance. It doesn't know about higher-level concerns like URL\\nrouting, conditional GETs, cross-origin cookie policies, or content\\nnegotiation. But it does know how to take care of framing,\\ncross-version differences in keep-alive handling, and the \\\"obsolete\\nline folding\\\" rule, so you can focus your energies on the hard /\\ninteresting parts for your application, and it tries to support the\\nfull specification in the sense that any useful HTTP/1.1 conformant\\napplication should be able to use h11.\\n\\nIt's pure Python, and has no dependencies outside of the standard\\nlibrary.\\n\\nIt has a test suite with 100.0% coverage for both statements and\\nbranches.\\n\\nCurrently it supports Python 3 (testing on 3.8-3.12) and PyPy 3.\\nThe last Python 2-compatible version was h11 0.11.x.\\n(Originally it had a Cython wrapper for `http-parser\\n<https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser>`_ and a beautiful nested state\\nmachine implemented with ``yield from`` to postprocess the output. But\\nI had to take these out -- the new *parser* needs fewer lines-of-code\\nthan the old *parser wrapper*, is written in pure Python, uses no\\nexotic language syntax, and has more features. It's sad, really; that\\nold state machine was really slick. I just need a few sentences here\\nto mourn that.)\\n\\nI don't know how fast it is. I haven't benchmarked or profiled it yet,\\nso it's probably got a few pointless hot spots, and I've been trying\\nto err on the side of simplicity and robustness instead of\\nmicro-optimization. But at the architectural level I tried hard to\\navoid fundamentally bad decisions, e.g., I believe that all the\\nparsing algorithms remain linear-time even in the face of pathological\\ninput like slowloris, and there are no byte-by-byte loops. (I also\\nbelieve that it maintains bounded memory usage in the face of\\narbitrary/pathological input.)\\n\\nThe whole library is ~800 lines-of-code. You can read and understand\\nthe whole thing in less than an hour. Most of the energy invested in\\nthis so far has been spent on trying to keep things simple by\\nminimizing special-cases and ad hoc state manipulation; even though it\\nis now quite small and simple, I'm still annoyed that I haven't\\nfigured out how to make it even smaller and simpler. (Unfortunately,\\nHTTP does not lend itself to simplicity.)\\n\\nThe API is ~feature complete and I don't expect the general outlines\\nto change much, but you can't judge an API's ergonomics until you\\nactually document and use it, so I'd expect some changes in the\\ndetails.\\n\\n*How do I try it?*\\n\\n.. code-block:: sh\\n\\n  $ pip install h11\\n  $ git clone git@github.com:python-hyper/h11\\n  $ cd h11/examples\\n  $ python basic-client.py\\n\\nand go from there.\\n\\n*License?*\\n\\nMIT\\n\\n*Code of conduct?*\\n\\nContributors are requested to follow our `code of conduct\\n<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ in\\nall project spaces.\\n\",\n",

<https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/HISTORY.rst>`_\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n=======\\n\\npsutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for\\nretrieving information on **running processes** and **system utilization**\\n(CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.\\nIt is useful mainly for **system monitoring**, **profiling and limiting process\\nresources** and **management of running processes**.\\nIt implements many functionalities offered by classic UNIX command line tools\\nsuch as *ps, top, iotop, lsof, netstat, ifconfig, free* and others.\\npsutil currently supports the following platforms:\\n\\n- **Linux**\\n- **Windows**\\n- **macOS**\\n- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD**, **NetBSD**\\n- **Sun Solaris**\\n- **AIX**\\n\\nSupported Python versions are cPython 3.6+ and `PyPy <https://pypy.org/>`__.\\nLatest psutil version supporting Python 2.7 is\\n`psutil 6.1.1 <https://pypi.org/project/psutil/6.1.1/>`__.\\n\\nFunding\\n=======\\n\\nWhile psutil is free software and will always be, the project would benefit\\nimmensely from some funding.\\nKeeping up with bug reports and maintenance has become hardly sustainable for\\nme alone in terms of time.\\nIf you're a company that's making significant use of psutil you can consider\\nbecoming a sponsor via `GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors/giampaolo>`__,\\n`Open Collective <https://opencollective.com/psutil>`__ or\\n`PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9ZS7PKKRM3S8>`__\\nand have your logo displayed in here and psutil `doc

Only the\\nhigh-level API is bound.\\n\\nDocumentation available at: http://freetype-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\n**From PyPI, recommended**: `pip install freetype-py`. This will install the\\nlibrary with a bundled FreeType binary, so you're ready to go on Windows,\\nmacOS and Linux (all with 32 and 64 bit x86 architecture support).\\n\\nDo note: if you specify the `--no-binary` paramater to pip, or use a different\\narchitecture for which we don't pre-compile binaries, the package will default\\nto using an external FreeType library. Specify the environment variable\\n`FREETYPEPY_BUNDLE_FT=1` before calling pip to compile a binary yourself.\\n\\nInstallation with compiling FreeType from source\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you don't want to or can't use the pre-built binaries, build FreeType\\nyourself: `export FREETYPEPY_BUNDLE_FT=yesplease && pip install .`.\\nThis will download and compile FreeType with Harfbuzz support as specified in\\n`setup-build-freetype.py`. Set the environment variable `PYTHON_ARCH` to 32 or\\n64 to explicitly set an architecture, default is whatever your host machine\\nuses. On macOS, we will always build a universal 32 and 64 bit Intel binary.\\n\\n- Windows: You need CMake and a C and C++ compiler, e.g. the Visual Code\\n  Community 2017 distribution with the desktop C++ workload.\\n- macOS: You need CMake and the XCode tools (full IDE not necessary)\\n- Linux: You need CMake, gcc and g++. For building a 32 bit library on a\\n  64 bit machine, you need gcc-multilib and g++-multilib (Debian) or\\n  glibc-devel.i686 and libstdc++-devel.i686 (Fedora).\\n\\nInstallation with an external FreeType library (the default)\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nInstall just the pure Python library and let it find a system-wide installed\\nFreeType at runtime.\\n\\nMac users\\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFreetype should be already installed on your system. If not, either install it\\nusing `homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ or compile it and place the library binary\\nfile in '/usr/local/lib'.\\n\\nLinux users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFreetype should be already installed on your system. If not, either install\\nrelevant package from your package manager or compile from sources and place\\nthe library binary file in '/usr/local/lib'.\\n\\nWindow users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThere are no official Freetype binary releases available, but they offer some\\nlinks to precompiled Windows DLLs. Please see the `FreeType Downloads\\n<https://www.freetype.org/download.html>`_ page for links.\\nYou can also compile the FreeType library from source yourself.\\n\\nIf you are using freetype-py on Windows with a 32-Bit version of Python, you\\nneed the 32-Bit version of the Freetype binary. The same applies for a 64-Bit\\nversion of Python.\\n\\nBecause of the way Windows searches for dll files, make sure the resulting\\nfile is named 'freetype.dll' (and not something like Freetype245.dll).\\nWindows expects the library in one of the directories listed in the $PATH\\nenvironment variable. As it is not recommended to place the dll in a Windows\\nsystem folder, you can choose one of the following ways to solve this:\\n\\n* Place library in a folder of your choice and edit the $PATH user\\n  environment variable\\n* Place library in a folder of your choice and edit the $PATH system\\n  environment variable\\n* For development purpose, place the library in the working directory of\\n  the application\\n* Place the library in one of the existing directories listed in $PATH\\n\\nTo get a complete list of all the directories in the $PATH\\nenvironment variable (user and system), open a command promt and type\\n\\n.. code::\\n\\n   echo %PATH%\\n\\nUsage example\\n=============\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n   import freetype\\n   face = freetype.Face(\\\"Vera.ttf\\\")\\n   face.set_char_size( 48*64 )\\n   face.load_char('S')\\n   bitmap = face.glyph.bitmap\\n   print(bitmap.buffer)\\n\\nScreenshots\\n===========\\n\\nScreenshot below comes from the wordle.py example. No clever tricks here, just\\nbrute force.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/wordle.png\\n\\nScreenshots below comes from the glyph-vector.py and glyph-vector-2.py\\nexamples showing how to access a glyph outline information and use it to draw\\nthe glyph. Rendering (with Bézier curves) is done using matplotlib.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/S.png\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/G.png\\n\\n\\nScreenshot below comes from the glyph-color.py showing how to draw and combine\\na glyph outline with the regular glyph.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/outline.png\\n\\nThe screenshot below comes from the hello-world.py example showing how to draw\\ntext in a bitmap (that has been zoomed in to show antialiasing).\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/hello-world.png\\n\\n\\nThe screenshot below comes from the agg-trick.py example showing an\\nimplementation of ideas from the `Texts Rasterization Exposures\\n<http://agg.sourceforge.net/antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/>`_ by\\nMaxim Shemarev.\\n\\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rougier/freetype-py/master/doc/_static/agg-trick.png\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

SQLAlchemy provides a full suite\\nof well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,\\ndesigned for efficient and high-performing database\\naccess, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain\\nlanguage.\\n\\nMajor SQLAlchemy features include:\\n\\n* An industrial strength ORM, built\\n  from the core on the identity map, unit of work,\\n  and data mapper patterns.   These patterns\\n  allow transparent persistence of objects\\n  using a declarative configuration system.\\n  Domain models\\n  can be constructed and manipulated naturally,\\n  and changes are synchronized with the\\n  current transaction automatically.\\n* A relationally-oriented query system, exposing\\n  the full range of SQL's capabilities\\n  explicitly, including joins, subqueries,\\n  correlation, and most everything else,\\n  in terms of the object model.\\n  Writing queries with the ORM uses the same\\n  techniques of relational composition you use\\n  when writing SQL.  While you can drop into\\n  literal SQL at any time, it's virtually never\\n  needed.\\n* A comprehensive and flexible system\\n  of eager loading for related collections and objects.\\n  Collections are cached within a session,\\n  and can be loaded on individual access, all\\n  at once using joins, or by query per collection\\n  across the full result set.\\n* A Core SQL construction system and DBAPI\\n  interaction layer.  The SQLAlchemy Core is\\n  separate from the ORM and is a full database\\n  abstraction layer in its own right, and includes\\n  an extensible Python-based SQL expression\\n  language, schema metadata, connection pooling,\\n  type coercion, and custom types.\\n* All primary and foreign key constraints are\\n  assumed to be composite and natural.  Surrogate\\n  integer primary keys are of course still the\\n  norm, but SQLAlchemy never assumes or hardcodes\\n  to this model.\\n* Database introspection and generation.  Database\\n  schemas can be \\\"reflected\\\" in one step into\\n  Python structures representing database metadata;\\n  those same structures can then generate\\n  CREATE statements right back out - all within\\n  the Core, independent of the ORM.\\n\\nSQLAlchemy's philosophy:\\n\\n* SQL databases behave less and less like object\\n  collections the more size and performance start to\\n  matter; object collections behave less and less like\\n  tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.\\n  SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate both of these\\n  principles.\\n* An ORM doesn't need to hide the \\\"R\\\".   A relational\\n  database provides rich, set-based functionality\\n  that should be fully exposed.   SQLAlchemy's\\n  ORM provides an open-ended set of patterns\\n  that allow a developer to construct a custom\\n  mediation layer between a domain model and\\n  a relational schema, turning the so-called\\n  \\\"object relational impedance\\\" issue into\\n  a distant memory.\\n* The developer, in all cases, makes all decisions\\n  regarding the design, structure, and naming conventions\\n  of both the object model as well as the relational\\n  schema.   SQLAlchemy only provides the means\\n  to automate the execution of these decisions.\\n* With SQLAlchemy, there's no such thing as\\n  \\\"the ORM generated a bad query\\\" - you\\n  retain full control over the structure of\\n  queries, including how joins are organized,\\n  how subqueries and correlation is used, what\\n  columns are requested.  Everything SQLAlchemy\\n  does is ultimately the result of a developer-initiated \\n  decision.\\n* Don't use an ORM if the problem doesn't need one.\\n  SQLAlchemy consists of a Core and separate ORM\\n  component.   The Core offers a full SQL expression\\n  language that allows Pythonic construction\\n  of SQL constructs that render directly to SQL\\n  strings for a target database, returning\\n  result sets that are essentially enhanced DBAPI\\n  cursors.\\n* Transactions should be the norm.  With SQLAlchemy's\\n  ORM, nothing goes to permanent storage until\\n  commit() is called.  SQLAlchemy encourages applications\\n  to create a consistent means of delineating\\n  the start and end of a series of operations.\\n* Never render a literal value in a SQL statement.\\n  Bound parameters are used to the greatest degree\\n  possible, allowing query optimizers to cache\\n  query plans effectively and making SQL injection\\n  attacks a non-issue.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nLatest documentation is at:\\n\\nhttps://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/\\n\\nInstallation / Requirements\\n---------------------------\\n\\nFull documentation for installation is at\\n`Installation <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/intro.html#installation>`_.\\n\\nGetting Help / Development / Bug reporting\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nPlease refer to the `SQLAlchemy Community Guide <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html>`_.\\n\\nCode of Conduct\\n---------------\\n\\nAbove all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\\nPlease see our current Code of Conduct at\\n`Code of Conduct <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\nSQLAlchemy is distributed under the `MIT license\\n<https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.\\n\\n\",\n",

Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\\n* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\\n* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\\n  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\\n  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\\n  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\\n  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\\n  and Windows registry-based time zones.\\n* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\\n  Olson's database.\\n* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\\n  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\\n* A comprehensive test suite.\\n\\nQuick example\\n=============\\nHere's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\\npackage. For more examples, look at the documentation.\\n\\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\\ndate out of the \\\"date\\\" unix system command. Here is the code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python3\\n\\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\\n    >>> from datetime import *\\n    >>> now = parse(\\\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\\\")\\n    >>> today = now.date()\\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\\n    >>> print(\\\"Today is: %s\\\" % today)\\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\\n    >>> print(\\\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\\\" % year)\\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\\n    >>> print(\\\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\\\" % rdelta)\\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\\n    >>> print(\\\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\\\" % (today+rdelta))\\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\\n\\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\\n\\nContributing\\n============\\n\\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).

status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/openforcefield/openff-units/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/openforcefield/openff-units/main)\\n[![conda](https://img.shields.io/conda/v/conda-forge/openff-units.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openff-units)\\n\\n\\nA common units module for the OpenFF software stack\\n\\n**Please note that there may still be some changes to the API prior to a stable 1.0.0 release.**\\n\\nThis package provides a common unit registry for all OpenFF packages to use in order to ensure consistent unit definitions across the software ecosystem.\\n\\nThe unit definitions are currently sourced from the NIST 2018 [CODATA](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/), but may be updated in future versions as new CODATA updates are made.\\n\\nWhile this repository is based on [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.16.1/), the main classes (`Unit`, `Quantity`, and `Measurement`) have been slightly modified in order to provide non-dynamic, more readily serialisable representations.\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nInstall via `conda` or a replacement:\\n\\n```shell\\nconda install openff-units -c conda-forge\\n```\\n\\n### Getting Started\\n\\nBelow shows how to tag a number with a unit (generating a `Quantity` object),\\nget its magnitude with and without units, convert to another unit, and also get its magnitude after converting to another unit.\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openff.units import unit\\n>>> bond_length = 1.4 * unit.angstrom\\n>>> bond_length\\n<Quantity(1.4, 'angstrom')>\\n>>> bond_length.magnitude\\n1.4\\n>>> bond_length.to(unit.nanometer)\\n<Quantity(0.14, 'nanometer')>\\n>>> bond_length.magnitude_as(unit.nanometer)\\n0.14\\n```\\n\\nOne could also do the [Pint tutorial](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.16.1/tutorial.html#tutorial) using the `unit` object above as a drop-in replacement for `ureg` in the tutorial.\\n\\n### Serialization\\n\\nScalar quantities can be serialized to strings using the built-in `str()` function and deserialized using the `unit.Quantity` constructor.\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> k = 10 * unit.kilocalorie / unit.mol / unit.nanometer**2\\n>>> k\\n<Quantity(10.0, 'kilocalorie / mole / nanometer ** 2')>\\n>>> str(k)\\n'10.0 kcal / mol / nm ** 2'\\n>>> unit.Quantity(str(k))\\n<Quantity(10.0, 'kilocalorie / mole / nanometer ** 2')>\\n```\\n\\n### OpenMM Interoperability\\n\\nFor compatibility with [OpenMM units](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/app.html#units), a submodule (`openff.units.openmm`) with conversion functions (`to_openmm`, `from_openmm`) is also provided.\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openff.units import unit\\n>>> from openff.units.openmm import to_openmm, from_openmm\\n>>> distance = 24.0 * unit.meter\\n>>> converted = to_openmm(distance)\\n>>> converted\\nQuantity(value=24.0, unit=meter)\\n>>> type(converted)\\n<class 'openmm.unit.quantity.Quantity'>\\n>>> roundtripped = from_openmm(converted)\\n>>> roundtripped\\n<Quantity(24.0, 'meter')>\\n>>> type(roundtripped)\\n<class 'openff.units.units.Quantity'>\\n```\\n\\nAn effort is made to convert from OpenMM constructs, such as when OpenMM provides array-like data as a list of `Vec3` objects:into Pint's wrapped NumPy arrays:\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openmm import app\\n>>> positions = app.PDBFile(\\\"top.pdb\\\").getPositions()\\n>>> positions\\nQuantity(value=[Vec3(x=-0.07890000000000001, y=-0.0198, z=-0.0), Vec3(x=-0.0006000000000000001, y=0.039200000000000006, z=-0.0), Vec3(x=0.07950000000000002, y=-0.0194, z=0.0), Vec3(x=0.9211, y=0.9802, z=1.0), Vec3(x=0.9994000000000001, y=1.0392, z=1.0), Vec3(x=1.0795000000000001, y=0.9805999999999999, z=1.0)], unit=nanometer)\\n>>> type(positions)\\n<class 'openmm.unit.quantity.Quantity'>\\n>>> type(positions._value)\\n<class 'list'>\\n>>> type(positions._value[0])\\n<class 'openmm.vec3.Vec3'>\\n>>> converted = from_openmm(positions)\\n>>> converted\\n<Quantity([[-7.8900e-02 -1.9800e-02 -0.0000e+00]\\n [-6.0000e-04  3.9200e-02 -0.0000e+00]\\n [ 7.9500e-02 -1.9400e-02  0.0000e+00]\\n [ 9.2110e-01  9.8020e-01  1.0000e+00]\\n [ 9.9940e-01  1.0392e+00  1.0000e+00]\\n [ 1.0795e+00  9.8060e-01  1.0000e+00]], 'nanometer')>\\n>>> converted.m\\narray([[-7.8900e-02, -1.9800e-02, -0.0000e+00],\\n

packages\\n\\nYou may find yourself needing to normalize a quantity to a particular unit package, while accepting inputs from either `openff.units` or `openmm.unit`. The [`ensure_quantity`] function simplifies this. It takes as arguments a quantity object from either unit solution and a string (`\\\"openff\\\"` or `\\\"openmm\\\"`) indicating the desired unit type, and returns a quantity from that package. If the quantity argument is already the requested type, the function short-circuits, so it should not introduce substantial overhead compared to simply requiring the target quantity type.\\n\\n[`ensure_quantity`]: https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/units/en/stable/api/generated/openff.units.ensure_quantity.html\\n\\n```python3\\n>>> from openff.units import unit, ensure_quantity\\n>>> ensure_quantity(unit.Quantity(4.0, unit.angstrom), \\\"openff\\\")\\n<Quantity(4.0, 'angstrom')>  # OpenFF\\n>>> ensure_quantity(unit.Quantity(4.0, unit.angstrom), \\\"openmm\\\")\\nQuantity(value=4.0, unit=angstrom)  # OpenMM\\n>>>\\n>>> import openmm.unit\\n>>> ensure_quantity(openmm.unit.Quantity(4.0, openmm.unit.angstrom), \\\"openmm\\\")\\nQuantity(value=4.0, unit=angstrom)  # OpenMM\\n>>> ensure_quantity(openmm.unit.Quantity(4.0, openmm.unit.angstrom), \\\"openff\\\")\\n<Quantity(4.0, 'angstrom')>  # OpenFF\\n```\\n\\n### Known issues\\n\\nThere is a quirk with cached unit registry definitions that can cause issues when running tests in parallel (i.e. with `pytest-xdist`). See [Issue #111](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-units/issues/111) for more details.\\n\\n### Copyright\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2021, Open Force Field Initiative\\n\\n\\n#### Acknowledgements\\n \\nProject based on the \\n[Computational Molecular Science Python Cookiecutter](https://github.com/molssi/cookiecutter-cms) version 1.5.\\n\",\n",

However,\\nthere are categories of characters that *occupy 2 cells* (full-wide), and\\nothers that *occupy 0* cells (zero-width).\\n\\n**Solution**: POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 conforming systems provide\\n`wcwidth(3)`_ and `wcswidth(3)`_ C functions of which this python module's\\nfunctions precisely copy.  *These functions return the number of cells a\\nunicode string is expected to occupy.*\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nThe stable version of this package is maintained on pypi, install using pip::\\n\\n    pip install wcwidth\\n\\nExample\\n-------\\n\\n**Problem**: given the following phrase (Japanese),\\n\\n   >>>  text = u'コンニチハ'\\n\\nPython **incorrectly** uses the *string length* of 5 codepoints rather than the\\n*printable length* of 10 cells, so that when using the `rjust` function, the\\noutput length is wrong::\\n\\n    >>> print(len('コンニチハ'))\\n    5\\n\\n    >>> print('コンニチハ'.rjust(20, '_'))\\n    _______________コンニチハ\\n\\nBy defining our own \\\"rjust\\\" function that uses wcwidth, we can correct this::\\n\\n   >>> def wc_rjust(text, length, padding=' '):\\n   ...    from wcwidth import wcswidth\\n   ...    return padding * max(0, (length - wcswidth(text))) + text\\n   ...\\n\\nOur **Solution** uses wcswidth to determine the string length correctly::\\n\\n   >>> from wcwidth import wcswidth\\n   >>> print(wcswidth('コンニチハ'))\\n   10\\n\\n   >>> print(wc_rjust('コンニチハ', 20, '_'))\\n   __________コンニチハ\\n\\n\\nChoosing a Version\\n------------------\\n\\nExport an environment variable, ``UNICODE_VERSION``. This should be done by\\n*terminal emulators* or those developers experimenting with authoring one of\\ntheir own, from shell::\\n\\n   $ export UNICODE_VERSION=13.0\\n\\nIf unspecified, the latest version is used. If your Terminal Emulator does not\\nexport this variable, you can use the `jquast/ucs-detect`_ utility to\\nautomatically detect and export it to your shell.\\n\\nwcwidth, wcswidth\\n-----------------\\nUse function ``wcwidth()`` to determine the length of a *single unicode\\ncharacter*, and ``wcswidth()`` to determine the length of many, a *string\\nof unicode characters*.\\n\\nBriefly, return values of function ``wcwidth()`` are:\\n\\n``-1``\\n  Indeterminate (not printable).\\n\\n``0``\\n  Does not advance the cursor, such as NULL or Combining.\\n\\n``2``\\n  Characters of category East Asian Wide (W) or East Asian\\n  Full-width (F) which are displayed using two terminal cells.\\n\\n``1``\\n  All others.\\n\\nFunction ``wcswidth()`` simply returns the sum of all values for each character\\nalong a string, or ``-1`` when it occurs anywhere along a string.\\n\\nFull API Documentation at https://wcwidth.readthedocs.org\\n\\n==========\\nDeveloping\\n==========\\n\\nInstall wcwidth in editable mode::\\n\\n   pip install -e .\\n\\nExecute unit tests using tox_::\\n\\n   tox -e py27,py35,py36,py37,py38,py39,py310,py311,py312\\n\\nUpdating Unicode Version\\n------------------------\\n\\nRegenerate python code tables from latest Unicode Specification data files::\\n\\n   tox -e update\\n\\nThe script is located at ``bin/update-tables.py``, requires Python 3.9 or\\nlater. It is recommended but not necessary to run this script with the newest\\nPython, because the newest Python has the latest ``unicodedata`` for generating\\ncomments.\\n\\nBuilding Documentation\\n----------------------\\n\\nThis project is using `sphinx`_ 4.5 to build documentation::\\n\\n   tox -e sphinx\\n\\nThe output will be in ``docs/_build/html/``.\\n\\nUpdating Requirements\\n---------------------\\n\\nThis project is using `pip-tools`_ to manage requirements.\\n\\nTo upgrade requirements for updating unicode version, run::\\n\\n   tox -e update_requirements_update\\n\\nTo upgrade requirements for testing, run::\\n\\n   tox -e update_requirements37,update_requirements39\\n\\nTo upgrade requirements for building documentation, run::\\n\\n   tox -e update_requirements_docs\\n\\nUtilities\\n---------\\n\\nSupplementary tools for browsing and testing terminals for wide unicode\\ncharacters are found in the `bin/`_ of this project's source code.

(For instance, with a Pygments lexer.)\\n- Multi-line input editing.\\n- Advanced code completion.\\n- Both Emacs and Vi key bindings. (Similar to readline.)\\n- Even some advanced Vi functionality, like named registers and digraphs.\\n- Reverse and forward incremental search.\\n- Works well with Unicode double width characters. (Chinese input.)\\n- Selecting text for copy/paste. (Both Emacs and Vi style.)\\n- Support for `bracketed paste <https://cirw.in/blog/bracketed-paste>`_.\\n- Mouse support for cursor positioning and scrolling.\\n- Auto suggestions. (Like `fish shell <http://fishshell.com/>`_.)\\n- Multiple input buffers.\\n- No global state.\\n- Lightweight, the only dependencies are Pygments and wcwidth.\\n- Runs on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Windows systems.\\n- And much more...\\n\\nFeel free to create tickets for bugs and feature requests, and create pull\\nrequests if you have nice patches that you would like to share with others.\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n************\\n\\n::\\n\\n    pip install prompt_toolkit\\n\\nFor Conda, do:\\n\\n::\\n\\n    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge prompt_toolkit\\n\\n\\nAbout Windows support\\n*********************\\n\\n``prompt_toolkit`` is cross platform, and everything that you build on top\\nshould run fine on both Unix and Windows systems. Windows support is best on\\nrecent Windows 10 builds, for which the command line window supports vt100\\nescape sequences. (If not supported, we fall back to using Win32 APIs for color\\nand cursor movements).\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the implementation is a \\\"best effort of what is\\npossible\\\". Both Unix and Windows terminals have their limitations. But in\\ngeneral, the Unix experience will still be a little better.\\n\\n\\nGetting started\\n***************\\n\\nThe most simple example of the library would look like this:\\n\\n.. code:: python\\n\\n    from prompt_toolkit import prompt\\n\\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\\n        answer = prompt('Give me some input: ')\\n        print('You said: %s' % answer)\\n\\nFor more complex examples, have a look in the ``examples`` directory. All\\nexamples are chosen to demonstrate only one thing. Also, don't be afraid to\\nlook at the source code. The implementation of the ``prompt`` function could be\\na good start.\\n\\nPhilosophy\\n**********\\n\\nThe source code of ``prompt_toolkit`` should be **readable**, **concise** and\\n**efficient**. We prefer short functions focusing each on one task and for which\\nthe input and output types are clearly specified. We mostly prefer composition\\nover inheritance, because inheritance can result in too much functionality in\\nthe same object. We prefer immutable objects where possible (objects don't\\nchange after initialization). Reusability is important. We absolutely refrain\\nfrom having a changing global state, it should be possible to have multiple\\nindependent instances of the same code in the same process. The architecture\\nshould be layered: the lower levels operate on primitive operations and data\\nstructures giving -- when correctly combined -- all the possible flexibility;\\nwhile at the higher level, there should be a simpler API, ready-to-use and\\nsufficient for most use cases. Thinking about algorithms and efficiency is\\nimportant, but avoid premature optimization.\\n\\n\\n`Projects using prompt_toolkit <PROJECTS.rst>`_\\n***********************************************\\n\\nSpecial thanks to\\n*****************\\n\\n- `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_: Syntax highlighter.\\n- `wcwidth <https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth>`_: Determine columns needed for a wide characters.\\n\\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/prompt_toolkit.svg\\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prompt-toolkit/\\n    :alt: Latest Version\\n\\n.. |AppVeyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/32r7s2skrgm9ubva?svg=true\\n    :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/\\n\\n.. |RTD| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-prompt-toolkit/badge/\\n    :target: https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/\\n\\n.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit.svg\\n    :target: https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/LICENSE\\n\\n.. |Codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg?style=flat\\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/\\n\\n\",\n",

I have asked myself the same question while\\nworking on this project. It is clear that there are excellent parsers out\\nthere but I wanted to experiment with another way of writing them.\\n\\nThe idea is quite simple. You write a class for every type of content\\n(called here ``ParsedStatement``) you need to parse. Each class should\\nhave a ``from_string`` constructor. We used extensively the ``typing``\\nmodule to make the output structure easy to use and less error prone.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    from dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\n    import flexparser as fp\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Assigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            lhs, rhs = s.split(\\\"<-\\\")\\n            return cls(lhs.strip(), rhs.strip())\\n\\n(using a frozen dataclass is not necessary but it convenient. Being a\\ndataclass you get the init, str, repr, etc for free. Being frozen, sort\\nof immutable, makes them easier to reason around)\\n\\nIn certain cases you might want to signal the parser\\nthat his class is not appropriate to parse the statement.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Assigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            if \\\"<-\\\" not in s:\\n                # This means: I do not know how to parse it\\n                # try with another ParsedStatement class.\\n                return None\\n            lhs, rhs = s.split(\\\"<-\\\")\\n            return cls(lhs.strip(), rhs.strip())\\n\\n\\nYou might also want to indicate that this is the right ``ParsedStatement``\\nbut something is not right:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class InvalidIdentifier(fp.ParsingError):\\n        value: str\\n\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Assigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            if \\\"<-\\\" not in s:\\n                # This means: I do not know how to parse it\\n                # try with another ParsedStatement class.\\n                return None\\n            lhs, rhs = (p.strip() for p in s.split(\\\"<-\\\"))\\n\\n            if not str.isidentifier(lhs):\\n                return InvalidIdentifier(lhs)\\n\\n            return cls(lhs, rhs)\\n\\n\\nPut this into ``source.txt``\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    one <- other\\n    2two <- new\\n    three <- newvalue\\n    one == three\\n\\nand then run the following code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    parsed = fp.parse(\\\"source.txt\\\", Assigment)\\n    for el in parsed.iter_statements():\\n        print(repr(el))\\n\\nwill produce the following output:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    BOF(start_line=0, start_col=0, end_line=0, end_col=0, raw=None, content_hash=Hash(algorithm_name='blake2b', hexdigest='37bc23cde7cad3ece96b7abf64906c84decc116de1e0486679eb6ca696f233a403f756e2e431063c82abed4f0e342294c2fe71af69111faea3765b78cb90c03f'), path=PosixPath('/Users/grecco/Documents/code/flexparser/examples/in_readme/source1.txt'), mtime=1658550284.9419456)\\n    Assigment(start_line=1, start_col=0, end_line=1, end_col=12, raw='one <- other', lhs='one', rhs='other')\\n    InvalidIdentifier(start_line=2, start_col=0, end_line=2, end_col=11, raw='2two <- new', value='2two')\\n    Assigment(start_line=3, start_col=0, end_line=3, end_col=17, raw='three <- newvalue', lhs='three', rhs='newvalue')\\n    UnknownStatement(start_line=4, start_col=0, end_line=4, end_col=12, raw='one == three')\\n    EOS(start_line=5, start_col=0, end_line=5, end_col=0, raw=None)\\n\\n\\nThe result is a collection of ``ParsedStatement`` or ``ParsingError`` (flanked by\\n``BOF`` and ``EOS`` indicating beginning of file and ending of stream respectively\\nAlternative, it can beginning with ``BOR`` with means beginning of resource and it\\nis used when parsing a Python Resource provided with a package).\\n\\nNotice that there are two correctly parsed statements (``Assigment``), one\\nerror found (``InvalidIdentifier``) and one unknown (``UnknownStatement``).\\n\\nCool, right?

It is a thin wrapper\\nover a dictionary mapping files to parsed content. Because we have provided a single file\\nand this does not contain a link another, our ``parsed`` object contains a single element.\\nThe key is ``None`` indicating that the file 'source.txt' was loaded from the root location\\n(None). The content is a ``ParsedSourceFile`` object with the following attributes:\\n\\n- **path**: full path of the source file\\n- **mtime**: modification file of the source file\\n- **content_hash**: hash of the pickled content\\n- **config**: extra parameters that can be given to the parser (see below).\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    ParsedSource(\\n        parsed_source=parse.<locals>.CustomRootBlock(\\n            opening=BOF(start_line=0, start_col=0, end_line=0, end_col=0, raw=None, content_hash=Hash(algorithm_name='blake2b', hexdigest='3d8ce0051dcdd6f0f80ef789a0df179509d927874f242005ac41ed886ae0b71a30b845b9bfcb30194461c0ef6a3ca324c36f411dfafc7e588611f1eb0269bb5a'), path=PosixPath('/Users/grecco/Documents/code/flexparser/examples/in_readme/source2.txt'), mtime=1658550707.1248093),\\n            body=(\\n                Block.subclass_with.<locals>.CustomBlock(\\n                    opening=Begin(start_line=1, start_col=0, end_line=1, end_col=5, raw='begin'),\\n                    body=(\\n                        Assigment(start_line=2, start_col=0, end_line=2, end_col=12, raw='one <- other', lhs='one', rhs='other'),\\n                        InvalidIdentifier(start_line=3, start_col=0, end_line=3, end_col=11, raw='2two <- new', value='2two'),\\n                        Assigment(start_line=4, start_col=0, end_line=4, end_col=17, raw='three <- newvalue', lhs='three', rhs='newvalue')\\n                    ),\\n                    closing=End(start_line=5, start_col=0, end_line=5, end_col=3, raw='end')),\\n                EqualityComparison(start_line=6, start_col=0, end_line=6, end_col=12, raw='one == three', lhs='one', rhs='three')),\\n            closing=EOS(start_line=7, start_col=0, end_line=7, end_col=0, raw=None)),\\n        config=None\\n    )\\n\\n\\nA few things to notice:\\n\\n1. We were using a block before without knowing. The ``RootBlock`` is a\\n   special type of Block that starts and ends automatically with the\\n   file.\\n2. ``opening``, ``body``, ``closing`` are automatically annotated with the\\n   possible ``ParsedStatement`` (plus `ParsingError`),\\n   therefore autocompletes works in most IDEs.\\n3. The same is true for the defined ``ParsedStatement`` (we have use\\n   ``dataclass`` for a reason). This makes using the actual\\n   result of the parsing a charm!.\\n4. That annoying ``subclass_with.<locals>`` is because we have built\\n   a class on the fly when we used ``Block.subclass_with``. You can\\n   get rid of it (which is actually useful for pickling) by explicit\\n   subclassing Block in your code (see below).\\n\\n\\nMultiple source files\\n---------------------\\n\\nMost projects have more than one source file internally connected.\\nA file might refer to another that also need to be parsed (e.g. an\\n`#include` statement in c). **flexparser** provides the ``IncludeStatement``\\nbase class specially for this purpose.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class Include(fp.IncludeStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"A naive implementation of #include \\\"file\\\"\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        value: str\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string(cls, s):\\n            if s.startwith(\\\"#include \\\"):\\n                return None\\n\\n            value = s[len(\\\"#include \\\"):].strip().strip('\\\"')\\n\\n            return cls(value)\\n\\n        @propery\\n        def target(self):\\n            return self.value\\n\\nThe only difference is that you need to implement a ``target`` property\\nthat returns the file name or resource that this statement refers to.\\n\\n\\nCustomizing statementization\\n----------------------------\\n\\nstatementi ... what? **flexparser** works by trying to parse each statement with\\none of the known classes. So it is fair to ask what is an statement in this\\ncontext and how can you configure it to your needs. A text file is split into\\nnon overlapping strings called **statements**. Parsing work as follows:\\n\\n1. each file is split into statements (can be single or multi line).\\n2. each statement is parsed with the first of the contextually\\n   available ParsedStatement or Block subclassed that returns\\n   a ``ParsedStatement`` or ``ParsingError``\\n\\nYou can customize how to split each line into statements with two arguments\\nprovided to parse:\\n\\n- **strip_spaces** (`bool`): indicates that leading and trailing spaces must\\n  be removed before attempting to parse.\\n  (default: True)\\n- **delimiters** (`dict`): indicates how each line must be subsplit.\\n  (default: do not divide)\\n\\nAn delimiter example might be\\n``{\\\";\\\": (fp.DelimiterInclude.SKIP, fp.DelimiterAction.CONTINUE)}``\\nwhich tells the statementizer (sorry) that when a \\\";\\\" is found a new statement should\\nbegin. ``DelimiterMode.SKIP`` tells that \\\";\\\" should not be added to the previous\\nstatement nor to the next. Other valid values are ``SPLIT_AFTER`` and ``SPLIT_BEFORE``\\nto append or prepend the delimiter character to the previous or next statement.\\nThe second element tells the statementizer (sorry again) what to do next:\\nvalid values are: `CONTINUE`, `CAPTURE_NEXT_TIL_EOL`, `STOP_PARSING_LINE`, and\\n`STOP_PARSING`.\\n\\nThis is useful with comments. For example,\\n``{\\\"#\\\": (fp.DelimiterMode.WITH_NEXT, fp.DelimiterAction.CAPTURE_NEXT_TIL_EOL))}``\\ntells the statementizer (it is not funny anymore) that after the first \\\"#\\\"\\nit should stop splitting and capture all.\\n\\nThis allows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    ## This will work as a single statement\\n    # This will work as a single statement #\\n    # This will work as # a single statement #\\n    a = 3 # this will produce two statements (a=3, and the rest)\\n\\n\\nExplicit Block classes\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    class AssigmentBlock(fp.Block[Begin, Assigment, End]):\\n        pass\\n\\n    class EntryBlock(fp.RootBlock[Union[AssigmentBlock, Equality]]):\\n        pass\\n\\n    parsed = fp.parse(\\\"source.txt\\\", EntryBlock)\\n\\n\\nCustomizing parsing\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn certain cases you might want to leave to the user some configuration\\ndetails. We have method for that!. Instead of overriding ``from_string``\\noverride ``from_string_and_config``. The second argument is an object\\nthat can be given to the parser, which in turn will be passed to each\\n``ParsedStatement`` class.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @dataclass(frozen=True)\\n    class NumericAssigment(fp.ParsedStatement):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Parses the following `this <- other`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        lhs: str\\n        rhs: numbers.Number\\n\\n        @classmethod\\n        def from_string_and_config(cls, s, config):\\n            if \\\"==\\\" not in s:\\n                # This means: I do not know how to parse it\\n                # try with another ParsedStatement class.\\n                return None\\n            lhs, rhs = s.split(\\\"==\\\")\\n            return cls(lhs.strip(), config.numeric_type(rhs.strip()))\\n\\n    class Config:\\n\\n        numeric_type = float\\n\\n    parsed = fp.parse(\\\"source.txt\\\", NumericAssigment, Config)\\n\\n----\\n\\nThis project was started as a part of Pint_, the python units package.\\n\\nSee AUTHORS_ for a list of the maintainers.\\n\\nTo review an ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project,\\nsee CHANGES_\\n\\n.. _`AUTHORS`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexparser/blob/main/AUTHORS\\n.. _`CHANGES`: https://github.com/hgrecco/flexparser/blob/main/CHANGES\\n.. _`Pint`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint\\n\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"# `pure_eval`\\n\\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexmojaki/pure_eval.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexmojaki/pure_eval) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/alexmojaki/pure_eval/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/alexmojaki/pure_eval?branch=master) [![Supports Python versions 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pure_eval.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pure_eval)\\n\\nThis is a Python package that lets you safely evaluate certain AST nodes without triggering arbitrary code that may have unwanted side effects.\\n\\nIt can be installed from PyPI:\\n\\n    pip install pure_eval\\n\\nTo demonstrate usage, suppose we have an object defined as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Rectangle:\\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\\n        self.width = width\\n        self.height = height\\n\\n    @property\\n    def area(self):\\n        print(\\\"Calculating area...\\\")\\n        return self.width * self.height\\n\\n\\nrect = Rectangle(3, 5)\\n```\\n\\nGiven the `rect` object, we want to evaluate whatever expressions we can in this source code:\\n\\n```python\\nsource = \\\"(rect.width, rect.height, rect.area)\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis library works with the AST, so let's parse the source code and peek inside:\\n\\n```python\\nimport ast\\n\\ntree = ast.parse(source)\\nthe_tuple = tree.body[0].value\\nfor node in the_tuple.elts:\\n    print(ast.dump(node))\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='width', ctx=Load())\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='height', ctx=Load())\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='area', ctx=Load())\\n```\\n\\nNow to actually use the library. First construct an Evaluator:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import Evaluator\\n\\nevaluator = Evaluator({\\\"rect\\\": rect})\\n```\\n\\nThe argument to `Evaluator` should be a mapping from variable names to their values. Or if you have access to the stack frame where `rect` is defined, you can instead use:\\n\\n```python\\nevaluator = Evaluator.from_frame(frame)\\n```\\n\\nNow to evaluate some nodes, using `evaluator[node]`:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(\\\"rect.width:\\\", evaluator[the_tuple.elts[0]])\\nprint(\\\"rect:\\\", evaluator[the_tuple.elts[0].value])\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\nrect.width: 3\\nrect: <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105b0dd30>\\n```\\n\\nOK, but you could have done the same thing with `eval`. The useful part is that it will refuse to evaluate the property `rect.area` because that would trigger unknown code. If we try, it'll raise a `CannotEval` exception.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import CannotEval\\n\\ntry:\\n    print(\\\"rect.area:\\\", evaluator[the_tuple.elts[2]])  # fails\\nexcept CannotEval as e:\\n    print(e)  # prints CannotEval\\n```\\n\\nTo find all the expressions that can be evaluated in a tree:\\n\\n```python\\nfor node, value in evaluator.find_expressions(tree):\\n    print(ast.dump(node), value)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='width', ctx=Load()) 3\\nAttribute(value=Name(id='rect', ctx=Load()), attr='height', ctx=Load()) 5\\nName(id='rect', ctx=Load()) <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105568d30>\\nName(id='rect', ctx=Load()) <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105568d30>\\nName(id='rect', ctx=Load()) <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x105568d30>\\n```\\n\\nNote that this includes `rect` three times, once for each appearance in the source code. Since all these nodes are equivalent, we can group them together:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import group_expressions\\n\\nfor nodes, values in group_expressions(evaluator.find_expressions(tree)):\\n    print(len(nodes), \\\"nodes with value:\\\", values)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\n1 nodes with value: 3\\n1 nodes with value: 5\\n3 nodes with value: <__main__.Rectangle object at 0x10d374d30>\\n```\\n\\nIf we want to list all the expressions in a tree, we may want to filter out certain expressions whose values are obvious. For example, suppose we have a function `foo`:\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo():\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\nIf we refer to `foo` by its name as usual, then that's not interesting:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pure_eval import is_expression_interesting\\n\\nnode = ast.parse('foo').body[0].value\\nprint(ast.dump(node))\\nprint(is_expression_interesting(node, foo))\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nName(id='foo', ctx=Load())\\nFalse\\n```\\n\\nBut if we refer to it by a different name, then it's interesting:\\n\\n```python\\nnode = ast.parse('bar').body[0].value\\nprint(ast.dump(node))\\nprint(is_expression_interesting(node, foo))\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nName(id='bar', ctx=Load())\\nTrue\\n```\\n\\nIn general `is_expression_interesting` returns False for the following values:\\n- Literals (e.g. `123`, `'abc'`, `[1, 2, 3]`, `{'a': (), 'b': ([1, 2], [3])}`)\\n- Variables or attributes whose name is equal to the value's `__name__`, such as `foo` above or `self.foo` if it was a method.\\n- Builtins (e.g. `len`) referred to by their usual name.\\n\\nTo make things easier, you can combine finding expressions, grouping them, and filtering out the obvious ones with:\\n\\n```python\\nevaluator.interesting_expressions_grouped(root)\\n```\\n\\nTo get the source code of an AST node, I recommend [asttokens](https://github.com/gristlabs/asttokens).\\n\\nHere's a complete example that brings it all together:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom asttokens import ASTTokens\\nfrom pure_eval import Evaluator\\n\\nsource = \\\"\\\"\\\"\\nx = 1\\nd = {x: 2}\\ny = d[x]\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nnames = {}\\nexec(source, names)\\natok = ASTTokens(source, parse=True)\\nfor nodes, value in Evaluator(names).interesting_expressions_grouped(atok.tree):\\n    print(atok.get_text(nodes[0]), \\\"=\\\", value)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 1\\nd = {1: 2}\\ny = 2\\nd[x] = 2\\n```\\n\",\n",

In particular, the [`ForceField`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField.html#openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField) class is used to load SMIRNOFF-format force fields and the [`create_openmm_system`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField.html#openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.ForceField.create_openmm_system) method enables the parametrization of small molecules into OpenMM objects.\\n\\nDetailed usage examples can be found in the [OpenFF Toolkit repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/tree/main/examples).\\n\\nEach mainline force field is currently available in two forms -- both with and without bond constraints to hydrogen. The default version of each force field (i.e. `openff-2.0.0.offxml`) is suitable for typical molecular dynamics simulations with constrained bonds to hydrogen. The \\\"unconstrained\\\" version of each force field (i.e. `openff_unconstrained-2.0.0.offxml`) should be used when single-point energies are a major concern (e.g. geometry optimizations) and when comparing the force field to QM data.\\n\\nThis repository may also contain other useful force fields, data, or utilities, separate from mainline OpenFF force fields. More information on those can be found in the `docs/` directory in this repository.\\n\\n## How to cite\\n\\nTo cite the **Parsley** line of force fields (`openff-1.Y.Z`) please use [this citation](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00571).\\n\\nTo cite the **Sage** line of force fields (`openff-2.Y.Z`) please use [this citation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00039).\\n\\nOptionally, consider also citing the version-specific Zenodo DOI for the particular force field from the table below.\\n\\nDetails for each force field in this repository can be found in the following table:\\n\\n| Filename                                    | DOI

If the [OpenFF Toolkit](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/) is installed, it will automatically detect and use this entry point when loading OFFXML files:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff import ForceField\\nff = ForceField('openff-2.0.0.offxml')\\n```\\n\\nOtherwise, the entry point can be [accessed by querying](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#entry-points) the `openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory` entry point group.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom importlib.metadata import entry_points\\n\\nfor entry_point in iter_entry_points(group='openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory'):\\n    print(entry_point.load()())\\n```\\n\\nFor convenience, the OpenFF Toolkit also has a standalone function [`get_available_force_fields`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.get_available_force_fields.html#openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield.get_available_force_fields) that lists the force fields discered by this entry point group:\\n\\n```pycon\\n>>> from openff.toolkit.typing.engines.smirnoff.forcefield import get_available_force_fields\\n>>> get_available_force_fields()\\n['smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.2.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.0.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.1.0.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.4.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.8.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.6.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.3.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.1.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.5.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.9.offxml', 'smirnoff99Frosst-1.0.7.offxml', 'ff14sb_off_impropers_0.0.2.offxml', 'ff14sb_0.0.1.offxml', 'ff14sb_0.0.3.offxml', 'ff14sb_off_impropers_0.0.1.offxml', 'ff14sb_off_impropers_0.0.3.offxml', 'ff14sb_0.0.2.offxml', 'openff-1.0.1.offxml', 'openff-1.1.1.offxml', 'openff-1.0.0-RC1.offxml', 'openff-1.2.0.offxml', 'openff-1.3.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-2.0.0-rc.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.3.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.2.1.offxml', 'openff-2.0.0-rc.2.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.0-RC2.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.1.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.0.offxml', 'openff-2.0.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-2.0.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-2.0.0-rc.2.offxml', 'openff-1.1.0.offxml', 'openff-1.0.0.offxml', 'openff-1.0.0-RC2.offxml', 'openff-1.3.1.offxml', 'openff-1.2.1.offxml', 'openff-1.3.1-alpha.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.0-RC1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.2.0.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.3.0.offxml', 'openff-2.0.0-rc.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.0.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.1.1.offxml', 'openff_unconstrained-1.3.1-alpha.1.offxml']\\n```\\n\\n## History\\n\\nForce fields in the Parsley and Sage lines are descended from the [SMIRNOFF99Frosst line of force fields](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/).\\nThe first official release (`openff-1.0.0.offxml`, code name \\\"Parsley\\\") was made in September 2019 as a result of the Open Force Field Initiative's refitting efforts.\\n\\n## General versioning guidelines\\n\\n_Applicable in general to SMIRNOFF-format FFs produced by the Open Force Field Consortium_\\n\\nForce fields moving forward will be called `name-X.Y.Z`\\n\\n* `X` denotes some major change in functional form or fitting strategy.\\n* `Y` is the parameterization epoch / generation, or a minor change that can affect energy.\\n* `Z` is a bugfix version -- e.g. something we've caught and corrected.\\n\\n\\n## Versions\\n- `v1.0.0 Parsley` : First major forcefield release.\\n\\n- `v1.0.1 Parsley `: This bugfix release contains following changes: (1) Addition of monatomic ion `LibraryCharges`.\\n\\n- `v1.1.0 Parsley `: This minor release contains following changes: (1) Addition of new proper torsions and improper torsions for tetrazole; (2) Corrections to N-N bond rotation periodicity; (3) Removal of redundant periodicity component in `t19`; (4) Addition of three new bond and angle terms, `a22a`, `b14a` and `b36a`.\\n\\n- `v1.1.1 Parsley `: This bugfix release contains following changes: (1) Addition of monatomic ion `LibraryCharges`.\\n\\n- `v1.2.0 Parsley `: This minor release contains following changes: (1) New, carefully designed quantum chemical dataset was utilized in training valence parameters in the force field and (2) Removal of redundancy in `t108` SMIRKS pattern\\n\\n- `v1.2.1 Parsley `: This bugfix release manually changes two bond force constants to resolve an issue seen in propyne substituents when using hydrogen mass repartitioning with a 4fs timestep. Full details are available at https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefields/issues/19.\\n\\n- `v1.3.0 Parsley `: This minor release contains a fix of amide-related issues; (1) a poor performance of v1.2 in reproducing amide torsional energy profiles and (2) absence of appropriate torsion parameters for dialkyl amides.\\n\\n- `v1.3.1-alpha.1 Parsley`: The new force field files in this release are adapted from the openff-1.3.0 release, except that two angle parameters have been reverted to their original values from smirnoff99Frosst 1.1.0, in an attempt to fix sulphonamide geometries.\\n\\n- `v1.3.1 Parsley`: This release is identical to `v1.3.1-alpha.1 Parsley`.\\n\\n- `v2.0.0-rc.1 Sage`: This major release candidate contains both refit valence and vdW terms. Full details are available at https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc.1\\n\\n- `v2.0.0-rc.2 Sage`: This major release candidate is identical to `v2.0.0-rc.1 Sage` except that the `angle` value for `a16` has been changed to `180.0 * degree`, as the previous value of `183... * degree` causes geometry optimizers to fail to converge.\\n\\n- `v2.0.0 Sage`: This major release contains the same physical parameters as `v2.0.0-rc.2 Sage`, but has the parameter ids changed. For more information see the [openff-sage repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage).\\n\\n- `2023.02.1`: This release switches to a calendar-versioning system and adds `tip3p-1.0.0.offxml` and `tip3p-fb-1.0.0.offxml`, as well as `tip3p.offxml` and `tip3p-fb.offxml`, which will always point to the latest files in their respective lines.\\n\\n- `2023.04.1`: This release adds `openff-2.1.0-rc.1.offxml` Sage 2.1.0 Release Candidate 1, with several small parameter fixes and improvements.\\n\\n- `2023.05.0`: This release adds the `opc-1.0.0.offxml`, our initial port of the OPC water model.\\n\\n- `2023.05.1`: This release adds `openff-2.1.0.offxml`, Sage 2.1.0, with identical physics parameters to `openff-2.1.0-rc.1.offxml`.\\n\\n- `2023.06.0`: This release adds `opc-1.0.1.offxml`, standardizing the use of the string \\\"kilocalorie_per_mole\\\". It also adds `tip3p-fb-1.1.0.offxml`, which fixes a unit error in the geometric constraints and adds additional ion parameters. Finally, it adds `opc3-1.0.0.offxml` and `tip4p_fb-1.0.0.offxml`.\\n\\n- `2024.01.0`: This release adds `openff-2.1.1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.1.1.offxml`, Sage 2.1.1, which has identical parameters to Sage 2.1.0 (originally released in version `2023.05.1` of the `openff-forcefields` package) but adds Xe van der Waals parameters from [Tang, K.T., Toennies, J.P. New combining rules for well parameters and shapes of the van der Waals potential of mixed rare gas systems. Z Phys D - Atoms, Molecules and Clusters 1, 91–101 (1986).](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01384663)\\n\\n- `2024.03.0`: This release adds `openff-2.2.0-rc1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.0-rc1.offxml`, Sage 2.2.0 Release Candidate 1, which modifies some small ring internal angles and remedies issues with sulfamide geometries.\\n\\n- `2024.04.0`: This release adds `openff-2.2.0.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.0.offxml`, Sage 2.2.0, with identical parameters to `openff-2.2.0-rc1.offxml`.\\n\\n- `2024.07.0`: This release adds `openff-2.2.1-rc1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.1-rc1.offxml`, which contains re-fit valence parameters where linear angles have been pinned to linear equilibrium values.\\n\\n- `2024.09.0` This release adds the Sage 2.2.1 force field with `openff-2.2.1.offxml` and `openff_unconstrained-2.2.1.offxml`, with identifical parameters to 2.2.1-rc1.\\n\\n#### Acknowledgements\\n\\nProject based on the\\n[Computational Molecular Science Python Cookiecutter](https://github.com/molssi/cookiecutter-cms) version 1.0.\\n\",\n",

We recommend creating a virtual\\nenvironment, using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__ or\\nPython 3 `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ module.\\n\\n.. code:: sh\\n\\n    # download the source code to 'fonttools' folder\\n    git clone https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools.git\\n    cd fonttools\\n\\n    # create new virtual environment called e.g. 'fonttools-venv', or anything you like\\n    python -m virtualenv fonttools-venv\\n\\n    # source the `activate` shell script to enter the environment (Unix-like); to exit, just type `deactivate`\\n    . fonttools-venv/bin/activate\\n\\n    # to activate the virtual environment in Windows `cmd.exe`, do\\n    fonttools-venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.bat\\n\\n    # install in 'editable' mode\\n    pip install -e .\\n\\nOptional Requirements\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ``fontTools`` package currently has no (required) external dependencies\\nbesides the modules included in the Python Standard Library.\\nHowever, a few extra dependencies are required by some of its modules, which\\nare needed to unlock optional features.\\nThe ``fonttools`` PyPI distribution also supports so-called \\\"extras\\\", i.e. a\\nset of keywords that describe a group of additional dependencies, which can be\\nused when installing via pip, or when specifying a requirement.\\nFor example:\\n\\n.. code:: sh\\n\\n    pip install fonttools[ufo,lxml,woff,unicode]\\n\\nThis command will install fonttools, as well as the optional dependencies that\\nare required to unlock the extra features named \\\"ufo\\\", etc.\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/etree.py``\\n\\n  The module exports a ElementTree-like API for reading/writing XML files, and\\n  allows to use as the backend either the built-in ``xml.etree`` module or\\n  `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__. The latter is preferred whenever present,\\n  as it is generally faster and more secure.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``lxml``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ufoLib``\\n\\n  Package for reading and writing UFO source files; it requires:\\n\\n  * `fs <https://pypi.org/pypi/fs>`__: (aka ``pyfilesystem2``) filesystem\\n    abstraction layer.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``ufo``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/woff2.py``\\n\\n  Module to compress/decompress WOFF 2.0 web fonts; it requires:\\n\\n  * `brotli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brotli>`__: Python bindings of\\n    the Brotli compression library.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``woff``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/sfnt.py``\\n\\n  To better compress WOFF 1.0 web fonts, the following module can be used\\n  instead of the built-in ``zlib`` library:\\n\\n  * `zopfli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopfli>`__: Python bindings of\\n    the Zopfli compression library.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``woff``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/unicode.py``\\n\\n  To display the Unicode character names when dumping the ``cmap`` table\\n  with ``ttx`` we use the ``unicodedata`` module in the Standard Library.\\n  The version included in there varies between different Python versions.\\n  To use the latest available data, you can install:\\n\\n  * `unicodedata2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodedata2>`__:\\n    ``unicodedata`` backport for Python 3.x updated to the latest Unicode\\n    version 15.0.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``unicode``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/interpolatable.py``\\n\\n  Module for finding wrong contour/component order between different masters.\\n  It requires one of the following packages in order to solve the so-called\\n  \\\"minimum weight perfect matching problem in bipartite graphs\\\", or\\n  the Assignment problem:\\n\\n  * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`__: the Scientific Library\\n    for Python, which internally uses `NumPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`__\\n    arrays and hence is very fast;\\n  * `munkres <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres>`__: a pure-Python\\n    module that implements the Hungarian or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.\\n\\n  To plot the results to a PDF or HTML format, you also need to install:\\n\\n  * `pycairo <https://pypi.org/project/pycairo/>`__: Python bindings for the\\n    Cairo graphics library. Note that wheels are currently only available for\\n    Windows, for other platforms see pycairo's `installation instructions\\n    <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``interpolatable``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/plot.py``\\n\\n  Module for visualizing DesignSpaceDocument and resulting VariationModel.\\n\\n  * `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/pypi/matplotlib>`__: 2D plotting library.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``plot``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/symfont.py``\\n\\n  Advanced module for symbolic font statistics analysis; it requires:\\n\\n  * `sympy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy>`__: the Python library for\\n    symbolic mathematics.\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``symfont``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/t1Lib.py``\\n\\n  To get the file creator and type of Macintosh PostScript Type 1 fonts\\n  on Python 3 you need to install the following module, as the old ``MacOS``\\n  module is no longer included in Mac Python:\\n\\n  * `xattr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr>`__: Python wrapper for\\n    extended filesystem attributes (macOS platform only).\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``type1``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/removeOverlaps.py``\\n\\n  Simplify TrueType glyphs by merging overlapping contours and components.\\n\\n  * `skia-pathops <https://pypi.python.org/pypy/skia-pathops>`__: Python\\n    bindings for the Skia library's PathOps module, performing boolean\\n    operations on paths (union, intersection, etc.).\\n\\n  *Extra:* ``pathops``\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/cocoaPen.py`` and ``Lib/fontTools/pens/quartzPen.py``\\n\\n  Pens for drawing glyphs with Cocoa ``NSBezierPath`` or ``CGPath`` require:\\n\\n  * `PyObjC <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc>`__: the bridge between\\n    Python and the Objective-C runtime (macOS platform only).\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/qtPen.py``\\n\\n  Pen for drawing glyphs with Qt's ``QPainterPath``, requires:\\n\\n  * `PyQt5 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5>`__: Python bindings for\\n    the Qt cross platform UI and application toolkit.\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/reportLabPen.py``\\n\\n  Pen to drawing glyphs as PNG images, requires:\\n\\n  * `reportlab <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab>`__: Python toolkit\\n    for generating PDFs and graphics.\\n\\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/freetypePen.py``\\n\\n  Pen to drawing glyphs with FreeType as raster images, requires:\\n\\n  * `freetype-py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/freetype-py>`__: Python binding\\n    for the FreeType library.\\n    \\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/tables/otBase.py``\\n\\n  Use the Harfbuzz library to serialize GPOS/GSUB using ``hb_repack`` method, requires:\\n  \\n  * `uharfbuzz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uharfbuzz>`__: Streamlined Cython\\n    bindings for the harfbuzz shaping engine\\n    \\n  *Extra:* ``repacker``\\n\\nHow to make a new release\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n1) Update ``NEWS.rst`` with all the changes since the last release. Write a\\n   changelog entry for each PR, with one or two short sentences summarizing it,\\n   as well as links to the PR and relevant issues addressed by the PR. Do not\\n   put a new title, the next command will do it for you.\\n2) Use semantic versioning to decide whether the new release will be a 'major',\\n   'minor' or 'patch' release. It's usually one of the latter two, depending on\\n   whether new backward compatible APIs were added, or simply some bugs were fixed.\\n3) From inside a venv, first do ``pip install -r dev-requirements.txt``, then run\\n   the ``python setup.py release`` command from the tip of the ``main`` branch.\\n   By default this bumps the third or 'patch' digit only, unless you pass ``--major``\\n   or ``--minor`` to bump respectively the first or second digit.\\n   This bumps the package version string, extracts the changes since the latest\\n   version from ``NEWS.rst``, and uses that text to create an annotated git tag\\n   (or a signed git tag if you pass the ``--sign`` option and your git and Github\\n   account are configured for `signing commits <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`__\\n   using a GPG key).\\n   It also commits an additional version bump which opens the main branch for\\n   the subsequent developmental cycle\\n4) Push both the tag and commit to the upstream repository, by running the command\\n   ``git push --follow-tags``. Note: it may push other local tags as well, be\\n   careful.\\n5) Let the CI build the wheel and source distribution packages and verify both\\n   get uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).\\n6) [Optional] Go to fonttools `Github Releases <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/releases>`__\\n   page and create a new release, copy-pasting the content of the git tag\\n   message. This way, the release notes are nicely formatted as markdown, and\\n   users watching the repo will get an email notification. One day we shall\\n   automate that too.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn alphabetical order:\\n\\naschmitz, Olivier Berten, Samyak Bhuta, Erik van Blokland, Petr van Blokland,\\nJelle Bosma, Sascha Brawer, Tom Byrer, Antonio Cavedoni, Frédéric Coiffier,\\nVincent Connare, David Corbett, Simon Cozens, Dave Crossland, Simon Daniels,\\nPeter Dekkers, Behdad Esfahbod, Behnam Esfahbod, Hannes Famira, Sam Fishman,\\nMatt Fontaine, Takaaki Fuji, Rob Hagemans, Yannis Haralambous, Greg Hitchcock,\\nJeremie Hornus, Khaled Hosny, John Hudson, Denis Moyogo Jacquerye, Jack Jansen,\\nTom Kacvinsky, Jens Kutilek, Antoine Leca, Werner Lemberg, Tal Leming, Liang Hai, Peter\\nLofting, Cosimo Lupo, Olli Meier, Masaya Nakamura, Dave Opstad, Laurence Penney,\\nRoozbeh Pournader, Garret Rieger, Read Roberts, Colin Rofls, Guido van Rossum,\\nJust van Rossum, Andreas Seidel, Georg Seifert, Chris Simpkins, Miguel Sousa,\\nAdam Twardoch, Adrien Tétar, Vitaly Volkov, Paul Wise.\\n\\nCopyrights\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n| Copyright (c) 1999-2004 Just van Rossum, LettError\\n  (just@letterror.com)\\n| See `LICENSE <LICENSE>`__ for the full license.\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2000 BeOpen.com.

sentinel value 0xFFFF to mark a glyph advance in hmtx/vmtx as non\\n  participating, allowing sparse masters to contain glyphs for variation purposes other\\n  than {H,V}VAR (#3235).\\n- [varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in non-default masters as missing, thus not participating\\n  in CFF2 delta computation, similarly to how varLib already treats them for gvar (#3234).\\n- Added varLib.avarPlanner

(#3164).\\n\\n4.40.0 (released 2023-06-12)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Published native binary wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions and platform\\n  and architectures currently supported that would benefit from this. They will include\\n  precompiled Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to compile them\\n  from source. The pure-python wheel and source distribution will continue to be\\n  published as always (pip will automatically chose them when no binary wheel is\\n  available for the given platform, e.g. pypy). Use ``pip install --no-binary=fonttools fonttools``\\n  to expliclity request pip to install from the pure-python source.\\n- [designspaceLib|varLib] Add initial support for specifying axis mappings and build\\n  ``avar2`` table from those (#3123).\\n- [feaLib] Support variable ligature caret position (#3130).\\n- [varLib|glyf] Added option to --drop-implied-oncurves; test for impliable oncurve\\n  points either before or after rounding (#3146, #3147, #3155, #3156).\\n- [TTGlyphPointPen] Don't error with empty contours, simply ignore them (#3145).\\n- [sfnt] Fixed str vs bytes remnant of py3 transition in code dealing with de/compiling\\n  WOFF metadata (#3129).\\n- [instancer-solver] Fixed bug when moving default instance with sparse masters (#3139, #3140).\\n- [feaLib] Simplify variable scalars that don’t vary (#3132).\\n- [pens] Added filter pen that explicitly emits closing line when lastPt != movePt (#3100).\\n- [varStore] Improve optimize algorithm and better document the algorithm (#3124, #3127).\\n  Added ``quantization`` option (#3126).\\n- Added CI workflow config file for building native binary wheels (#3121).\\n- [fontBuilder] Added glyphDataFormat=0 option; raise error when glyphs contain cubic\\n  outlines but glyphDataFormat was not explicitly set to 1 (#3113, #3119).\\n- [subset] Prune emptied GDEF.MarkGlyphSetsDef and remap indices; ensure GDEF is\\n  subsetted before GSUB and GPOS (#3114, #3118).\\n- [xmlReader] Fixed issue whereby DSIG table data was incorrectly parsed (#3115, #2614).\\n- [varLib/merger] Fixed merging of SinglePos with pos=0 (#3111, #3112).\\n- [feaLib] Demote \\\"Feature has not been defined\\\" error to a warning when building aalt\\n  and referenced feature is empty (#3110).\\n- [feaLib] Dedupe multiple substitutions with classes (#3105).\\n\\n4.39.4 (released 2023-05-10)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow for sparse masters (#3075)\\n- [merge] Handle differing default/nominalWidthX in CFF (#3070)\\n- [ttLib] Add missing main.py file to ttLib package (#3088)\\n- [ttx] Fix missing composite instructions in XML (#3092)\\n- [ttx] Fix split tables option to work on filenames containing '%' (#3096)\\n- [featureVars] Process lookups for features other than rvrn last (#3099)\\n- [feaLib] support multiple substitution with classes (#3103)\\n\\n4.39.3 (released 2023-03-28)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [sbix] Fixed TypeError when compiling empty glyphs whose imageData is None, regression\\n  was introduced in v4.39 (#3059).\\n- [ttFont] Fixed AttributeError on python <= 3.10 when opening a TTFont from a tempfile\\n  SpooledTemporaryFile, seekable method only added on python 3.11 (#3052).\\n\\n4.39.2 (released 2023-03-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Fixed regression introduced in 4.39.1 whereby an incomplete 'STAT' table\\n  would be built even though a DesignSpace v5 did contain 'STAT' definitions (#3045, #3046).\\n\\n4.39.1 (released 2023-03-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [avar2] Added experimental support for reading/writing avar version 2 as specified in\\n  this draft proposal: https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/avar2.md\\n- [glifLib] Wrap underlying XML library exceptions with GlifLibError when parsing GLIFs,\\n  and also print the name and path of the glyph that fails to be parsed (#3042).\\n- [feaLib] Consult avar for normalizing user-space values in ConditionSets and in\\n  VariableScalars (#3042, #3043).\\n- [ttProgram] Handle string input to Program.fromAssembly() (#3038).\\n- [otlLib] Added a config option to emit GPOS 7 lookups, currently disabled by default\\n  because of a macOS bug (#3034).\\n- [COLRv1] Added method to automatically compute ClipBoxes (#3027).\\n- [ttFont] Fixed getGlyphID to raise KeyError on missing glyphs instead of returning\\n  None.

Kudos to behdad for\\n  spotting one of the oldest bugs in FT. Probably nobody has ever dared to make\\n  glyphs with more than 32767 points... (#2957).\\n- [feaLib] Fixed handling of ``ignore`` statements with unmarked glyphs to match\\n  makeotf behavior, which assumes the first glyph is marked (#2950).\\n- Reformatted code with ``black`` and enforce new code style via CI check (#2925).\\n- [feaLib] Sort name table entries following OT spec prescribed order in the builder (#2927).\\n- [cu2quPen] Add Cu2QuMultiPen that converts multiple outlines at a time in\\n  interpolation compatible way; its methods take a list of tuples arguments\\n  that would normally be passed to individual segment pens, and at the end it\\n  dispatches the converted outlines to each pen (#2912).\\n- [reverseContourPen/ttGlyphPen] Add outputImpliedClosingLine option (#2913, #2914,\\n  #2921, #2922, #2995).\\n- [gvar] Avoid expanding all glyphs unnecessarily upon compile (#2918).\\n- [scaleUpem] Fixed bug whereby CFF2 vsindex was scaled; it should not (#2893, #2894).\\n- [designspaceLib] Add DS.getAxisByTag and refactor getAxis (#2891).\\n- [unicodedata] map Zmth<->math in ot_tag_{to,from}_script (#1737, #2889).\\n- [woff2] Support encoding/decoding OVERLAP_SIMPLE glyf flags (#2576, #2884).\\n- [instancer] Update OS/2 class and post.italicAngle when default moved (L4)\\n- Dropped support for Python 3.7 which reached EOL, fontTools requires 3.8+.\\n- [instancer] Fixed instantiateFeatureVariations logic when a rule range becomes\\n  default-applicable (#2737, #2880).\\n- [ttLib] Add main to ttFont and ttCollection that just decompile and re-compile the\\n  input font (#2869).\\n- [featureVars] Insert 'rvrn' lookup at the beginning of LookupList, to work around bug\\n  in Apple implementation of 'rvrn' feature which the spec says it should be processed\\n  early whereas on macOS 10.15 it follows lookup order (#2140, #2867).\\n- [instancer/mutator] Remove 'DSIG' table if present.\\n- [svgPathPen] Don't close path in endPath(), assume open unless closePath() (#2089, #2865).\\n\\n4.38.0 (released 2022-10-21)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.instancer] Added support for L4 instancing, i.e. moving the default value of\\n  an axis while keeping it variable. Thanks Behdad! (#2728, #2861).\\n  It's now also possible to restrict an axis min/max values beyond the current default\\n  value, e.g. a font wght has min=100, def=400, max=900 and you want a partial VF that\\n  only varies between 500 and 700, you can now do that.\\n  You can either specify two min/max values (wght=500:700), and the new default will be\\n  set to either the minimum or maximum, depending on which one is closer to the current\\n  default (e.g. 500 in this case). Or you can specify three values (e.g. wght=500:600:700)\\n  to specify the new default value explicitly.\\n- [otlLib/featureVars] Set a few Count values so one doesn't need to compile the font\\n  to update them (#2860).\\n- [varLib.models] Make extrapolation work for 2-master models as well where one master\\n  is at the default location (#2843, #2846).\\n  Add optional extrapolate=False to normalizeLocation() (#2847, #2849).\\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed sub-optimal packing of CFF2 deltas by no longer rounding them to\\n  integer (#2838).\\n- [scaleUpem] Calculate numShorts in VarData after scale; handle CFF hintmasks (#2840).\\n\\n4.37.4 (released 2022-09-30)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Keep nameIDs used by CPAL palette entry labels (#2837).\\n- [varLib] Avoid negative hmtx values when creating font from variable CFF2 font (#2827).\\n- [instancer] Don't prune stat.ElidedFallbackNameID (#2828).\\n- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/Blocks to Unicode 15.0 (#2833).\\n\\n4.37.3 (released 2022-09-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Fix arguments in calls to (glyf) glyph.draw() and drawPoints(), whereby offset wasn't\\n  correctly passed down; this fix also exposed a second bug, where lsb and tsb were not\\n  set (#2824, #2825, adobe-type-tools/afdko#1560).\\n\\n4.37.2 (released 2022-09-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Keep CPAL table and don't attempt to prune unused color indices if OT-SVG\\n  table is present even if COLR table was subsetted away; OT-SVG may be referencing the\\n  CPAL table; for now we assume that's the case (#2814, #2815).\\n- [varLib.instancer] Downgrade GPOS/GSUB version if there are no more FeatureVariations\\n  after instancing (#2812).\\n- [subset] Added ``--no-lazy`` to optionally load fonts eagerly (mostly to ease\\n  debugging of table lazy loading, no practical effects) (#2807).\\n- [varLib] Avoid building empty COLR.DeltaSetIndexMap with only identity mappings (#2803).\\n- [feaLib] Allow multiple value record types (by promoting to the most general format)\\n  within the same PairPos subtable; e.g. this allows variable and non variable kerning\\n  rules to share the same subtable. This also fixes a bug whereby some kerning pairs\\n  would become unreachable while shapiong because of premature subtable splitting (#2772, #2776).\\n- [feaLib] Speed up ``VarScalar`` by caching models for recurring master locations (#2798).\\n- [feaLib] Optionally cythonize ``feaLib.lexer``, speeds up parsing FEA a bit (#2799).\\n- [designspaceLib] Avoid crash when handling unbounded rule conditions (#2797).\\n- [post] Don't crash if ``post`` legacy format 1 is malformed/improperly used (#2786)\\n- [gvar] Don't be \\\"lazy\\\" (load all glyph variations up front) when TTFont.lazy=False (#2771).\\n- [TTFont] Added ``normalizeLocation`` method to normalize a location dict from the\\n  font's defined axes space (also known as \\\"user space\\\") into the normalized (-1..+1)\\n  space.

Added ``fontTools.ttLib.scaleUpem`` module that uses the latter to\\n  change a font's units-per-em and scale all the related fields accordingly (#2718,\\n  #2755).\\n\\n4.36.0 (released 2022-08-17)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.models] Use a simpler model that generates narrower \\\"tents\\\" (regions, master\\n  supports) whenever possible: specifically when any two axes that actively \\\"cooperate\\\"\\n  (have masters at non-zero positions for both axes) have a complete set of intermediates.\\n  The simpler algorithm produces fewer overlapping regions and behaves better with\\n  respect to rounding at the peak positions than the generic solver, always matching\\n  intermediate masters exactly, instead of maximally 0.5 units off. This may be useful\\n  when 100% metrics compatibility is desired (#2218, #2717).\\n- [feaLib] Remove warning when about ``GDEF`` not being built when explicitly not\\n  requested; don't build one unconditonally even when not requested (#2744, also works\\n  around #2747).\\n- [ttFont] ``TTFont.getGlyphSet`` method now supports selecting a location that\\n  represents an instance of a variable font (supports both user-scale and normalized\\n  axes coordinates via the ``normalized=False`` parameter). Currently this only works\\n  for TrueType-flavored variable fonts (#2738).\\n\\n4.35.0 (released 2022-08-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otData/otConverters] Added support for 'biased' PaintSweepGradient start/end angles\\n  to match latest COLRv1 spec (#2743).\\n- [varLib.instancer] Fixed bug in ``_instantiateFeatureVariations`` when at the same\\n  time pinning one axis and restricting the range of a subsequent axis; the wrong axis\\n  tag was being used in the latter step (as the records' axisIdx was updated in the\\n  preceding step but looked up using the old axes order in the following step) (#2733,\\n  #2734).\\n- [mtiLib] Pad script tags with space when less than 4 char long (#1727).\\n- [merge] Use ``'.'`` instead of ``'#'`` in duplicate glyph names (#2742).\\n- [gvar] Added support for lazily loading glyph variations (#2741).\\n- [varLib] In ``build_many``, we forgot to pass on ``colr_layer_reuse`` parameter to\\n  the ``build`` method (#2730).\\n- [svgPathPen] Add a main that prints SVG for input text (6df779fd).\\n- [cffLib.width] Fixed off-by-one in optimized values; previous code didn't match the\\n  code block above it (2963fa50).\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Support reading .designspace and .glyphs files (via optional\\n  ``glyphsLib``).\\n- Compile some modules with Cython when available and building/installing fonttools\\n  from source: ``varLib.iup`` (35% faster), ``pens.momentsPen`` (makes\\n  ``varLib.interpolatable`` 3x faster).\\n- [feaLib] Allow features to be built for VF without also building a GDEF table (e.g.\\n  only build GSUB); warn when GDEF would be needed but isn't requested (#2705, 2694).\\n- [otBase] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when uharfbuzz < 0.23.0 and 'repack' method is\\n  missing (32aa8eaf). Use new ``uharfbuzz.repack_with_tag`` when available (since\\n  uharfbuzz>=0.30.0), enables table-specific optimizations to be performed during\\n  repacking (#2724).\\n- [statisticsPen] By default report all glyphs (4139d891). Avoid division-by-zero\\n  (52b28f90).\\n- [feaLib] Added missing required argument to FeatureLibError exception (#2693)\\n- [varLib.merge] Fixed error during error reporting (#2689). Fixed undefined\\n  ``NotANone`` variable (#2714).\\n\\n4.34.4 (released 2022-07-07)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Fixed typo in varLib/merger.py that causes NameError merging COLR glyphs\\n  containing more than 255 layers (#2685).\\n\\n4.34.3 (released 2022-07-07)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Don't make up bad PS names when no STAT data (#2684)\\n\\n4.34.2 (released 2022-07-06)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varStore/subset] fixed KeyError exception to do with NO_VARIATION_INDEX while\\n  subsetting varidxes in GPOS/GDEF (a08140d).\\n\\n4.34.1 (released 2022-07-06)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [instancer] When optimizing HVAR/VVAR VarStore, use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=False to avoid\\n  including NO_VARIATION_INDEX in AdvWidthMap, RsbMap, LsbMap mappings, which would\\n  push the VarIdx width to maximum (4bytes), which is not desirable. This also fixes\\n  a hard crash when attempting to subset a varfont after it had been partially instanced\\n  with use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=True.\\n\\n4.34.0 (released 2022-07-06)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [instancer] Set RIBBI bits in head and OS/2 table when cutting instances and the\\n  subfamily nameID=2 contains strings like 'Italic' or 'Bold' (#2673).\\n- [otTraverse] Addded module containing methods for traversing trees of otData tables\\n  (#2660).\\n- [otTables] Made DeltaSetIndexMap TTX dump less verbose by omitting no-op entries\\n  (#2660).\\n- [colorLib.builder] Added option to disable PaintColrLayers's reuse of layers from\\n  LayerList (#2660).\\n- [varLib] Added support for merging multiple master COLRv1 tables into a variable\\n  COLR table (#2660, #2328). Base color glyphs of same name in different masters must have\\n  identical paint graph structure (incl. number of layers, palette indices, number\\n  of color line stops, corresponding paint formats at each level of the graph),\\n  but can differ in the variable fields (e.g. PaintSolid.Alpha). PaintVar* tables\\n  are produced when this happens and a VarStore/DeltaSetIndexMap is added to the\\n  variable COLR table. It is possible for non-default masters to be 'sparse', i.e.\\n  omit some of the color glyphs present in the default master.\\n- [feaLib] Let the Parser set nameIDs 1 through 6 that were previously reserved (#2675).\\n- [varLib.varStore] Support NO_VARIATION_INDEX in optimizer and instancer.\\n- [feaLib] Show all missing glyphs at once at end of parsing (#2665).\\n- [varLib.iup] Rewrite force-set conditions and limit DP loopback length (#2651).\\n  For Noto Sans, IUP time drops from 23s down to 9s, with only a slight size increase\\n  in the final font. This basically turns the algorithm from O(n^3) into O(n).\\n- [featureVars] Report about missing glyphs in substitution rules (#2654).\\n- [mutator/instancer] Added CLI flag to --no-recalc-timestamp (#2649).\\n- [SVG] Allow individual SVG documents in SVG OT table to be compressed on uncompressed,\\n  and remember that when roundtripping to/from ttx. The SVG.docList is now a list\\n  of SVGDocument namedtuple-like dataclass containing an extra ``compressed`` field,\\n  and no longer a bare 3-tuple (#2645).\\n- [designspaceLib] Check for descriptor types with hasattr() to allow custom classes\\n  that don't inherit the default descriptors (#2634).\\n- [subset] Enable sharing across subtables of extension lookups for harfbuzz packing\\n  (#2626). Updated how table packing falls back to fontTools from harfbuzz (#2668).\\n- [subset] Updated default feature tags following current Harfbuzz (#2637).\\n- [svgLib] Fixed regex for real number to support e.g. 1e-4 in addition to 1.0e-4.\\n  Support parsing negative rx, ry on arc commands (#2596, #2611).\\n- [subset] Fixed subsetting SinglePosFormat2 when ValueFormat=0 (#2603).\\n\\n4.33.3 (released 2022-04-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Fixed typo in ``deepcopyExceptFonts`` method, preventing font\\n  references to be transferred (#2600). Fixed another typo in the name of ``Range``\\n  dataclass's ``__post_init__`` magic method (#2597).\\n\\n4.33.2 (released 2022-04-22)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otBase] Make logging less verbose when harfbuzz fails to serialize. Do not exit\\n  at the first failure but continue attempting to fix offset overflow error using\\n  the pure-python serializer even when the ``USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER`` option was\\n  explicitly set to ``True``. This is normal with fonts with relatively large\\n  tables, at least until hb.repack implements proper table splitting.\\n\\n4.33.1 (released 2022-04-22)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otlLib] Put back the ``FONTTOOLS_GPOS_COMPACT_MODE`` environment variable to fix\\n  regression in ufo2ft (and thus fontmake) introduced with v4.33.0 (#2592, #2593).\\n  This is deprecated and will be removed one ufo2ft gets updated to use the new\\n  config setup.\\n\\n4.33.0 (released 2022-04-21)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [OS/2 / merge] Automatically recalculate ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` after merging\\n  fonts with ``fontTools.merge`` (#2591, #2538).\\n- [misc/config] Added ``fontTools.misc.configTools`` module, a generic configuration\\n  system (#2416, #2439).\\n  Added ``fontTools.config`` module, a fontTools-specific configuration\\n  system using ``configTools`` above.\\n  Attached a ``Config`` object to ``TTFont``.\\n- [otlLib] Replaced environment variable for GPOS compression level with an\\n  equivalent option using the new config system.\\n- [designspaceLib] Incremented format version to 5.0 (#2436).\\n  Added discrete axes, variable fonts, STAT information, either design- or\\n  user-space location on instances.\\n  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.split`` module to split a designspace\\n  into sub-spaces that interpolate and that represent the variable fonts\\n  listed in the document.\\n  Made instance names optional and allow computing them from STAT data instead.\\n  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.statNames`` module.\\n  Allow instances to have the same location as a previously defined STAT label.\\n  Deprecated some attributes:\\n  ``SourceDescriptor``: ``copyLib``, ``copyInfo``, ``copyGroups``, ``copyFeatures``.\\n  ``InstanceDescriptor``: ``kerning``, ``info``; ``glyphs``: use rules or sparse\\n  sources.\\n  For both, ``location``: use the more explicit designLocation.\\n  Note: all are soft deprecations and existing code should keep working.\\n  Updated documentation for Python methods and the XML format.\\n- [varLib] Added ``build_many`` to build several variable fonts from a single\\n  designspace document (#2436).\\n  Added ``fontTools.varLib.stat`` module to build STAT tables from a designspace\\n  document.\\n- [otBase] Try to use the Harfbuzz Repacker for packing GSUB/GPOS tables when\\n  ``uharfbuzz`` python bindings are available (#2552). Disable it by setting the\\n  \\\"fontTools.ttLib.tables.otBase:USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER\\\" config option to ``False``.\\n  If the option is set explicitly to ``True`` but ``uharfbuzz`` can't be imported\\n  or fails to serialize for any reasons, an error will be raised (ImportError or\\n  uharfbuzz errors).\\n- [CFF/T2] Ensure that ``pen.closePath()`` gets called for CFF2 charstrings (#2577).\\n  Handle implicit CFF2 closePath within ``T2OutlineExtractor`` (#2580).\\n\\n4.32.0 (released 2022-04-08)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otlLib] Disable GPOS7 optimization to work around bug in Apple CoreText.\\n  Always force Chaining GPOS8 for now (#2540).\\n- [glifLib] Added ``outputImpliedClosingLine=False`` parameter to ``Glyph.draw()``,\\n  to control behaviour of ``PointToSegmentPen`` (6b4e2e7).\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Check for wrong contour starting point (#2571).\\n- [cffLib] Remove leftover ``GlobalState`` class and fix calls to ``TopDictIndex()``\\n  (#2569, #2570).\\n- [instancer] Clear ``AxisValueArray`` if it is empty after instantiating (#2563).\\n\\n4.31.2 (released 2022-03-22)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] fix instantiation of GPOS SinglePos values (#2555).\\n\\n4.31.1 (released 2022-03-18)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] fix subsetting OT-SVG when glyph id attribute is on the root ``<svg>``\\n  element (#2553).\\n\\n4.31.0 (released 2022-03-18)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ttCollection] Fixed 'ResourceWarning: unclosed file' warning (#2549).\\n- [varLib.merger] Handle merging SinglePos with valueformat=0 (#2550).\\n- [ttFont] Update glyf's glyphOrder when calling TTFont.setGlyphOrder() (#2544).\\n- [ttFont] Added ``ensureDecompiled`` method to load all tables irrespective\\n  of the ``lazy`` attribute (#2551).\\n- [otBase] Added ``iterSubTable`` method to iterate over BaseTable's children of\\n  type BaseTable; useful for traversing a tree of otTables (#2551).\\n\\n4.30.0 (released 2022-03-10)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Added debug logger showing the glyph name for which ``gvar`` is built (#2542).\\n- [varLib.errors] Fixed undefined names in ``FoundANone`` and ``UnsupportedFormat``\\n  exceptions (ac4d5611).\\n- [otlLib.builder] Added ``windowsNames`` and ``macNames`` (bool) parameters to the\\n  ``buildStatTabe`` function, so that one can select whether to only add one or both\\n  of the two sets (#2528).\\n- [t1Lib] Added the ability to recreate PostScript stream (#2504).\\n- [name] Added ``getFirstDebugName``, ``getBest{Family,SubFamily,Full}Name`` methods (#2526).\\n\\n4.29.1 (released 2022-02-01)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Fixed rounding issue with radial gradient's start/end circles inside\\n  one another (#2521).\\n- [freetypePen] Handle rotate/skew transform when auto-computing width/height of the\\n  buffer; raise PenError wen missing moveTo (#2517)\\n\\n4.29.0 (released 2022-01-24)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ufoLib] Fixed illegal characters and expanded reserved filenames (#2506).\\n- [COLRv1] Don't emit useless PaintColrLayers of lenght=1 in LayerListBuilder (#2513).\\n- [ttx] Removed legacy ``waitForKeyPress`` method on Windows (#2509).\\n- [pens] Added FreeTypePen that uses ``freetype-py`` and the pen protocol for\\n  rasterizating outline paths (#2494).\\n- [unicodedata] Updated the script direction list to Unicode 14.0 (#2484).\\n  Bumped unicodedata2 dependency to 14.0 (#2499).\\n- [psLib] Fixed type of ``fontName`` in ``suckfont`` (#2496).\\n\\n4.28.5 (released 2021-12-19)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [svgPathPen] Continuation of #2471: make sure all occurrences of ``str()`` are now\\n  replaced with user-defined ``ntos`` callable.\\n- [merge] Refactored code into submodules, plus several bugfixes and improvements:\\n  fixed duplicate-glyph-resolution GSUB-lookup generation code; use tolerance in glyph\\n  comparison for empty glyph's width; ignore space of default ignorable glyphs;\\n  downgrade duplicates-resolution missing-GSUB from assert to warn; added --drop-tables\\n  option (#2473, #2475, #2476).\\n\\n4.28.4 (released 2021-12-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [merge] Merge GDEF marksets in Lookups properly (#2474).\\n- [feaLib] Have ``fontTools feaLib`` script exit with error code when build fails (#2459)\\n- [svgPathPen] Added ``ntos`` option to customize number formatting (e.g. rounding) (#2471).\\n- [subset] Speed up subsetting of large CFF fonts (#2467).\\n- [otTables] Speculatively promote lookups to extension to speed up compilation. If the\\n  offset to lookup N is too big to fit in a ushort, the offset to lookup N+1 is going to\\n  be too big as well, so we promote to extension all lookups from lookup N onwards (#2465).\\n\\n4.28.3 (released 2021-12-03)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fixed bug while subsetting ``COLR`` table, whereby incomplete layer records\\n  pointing to missing glyphs were being retained leading to ``struct.error`` upon\\n  compiling.

They are now treated\\n  as if they are closed, like with the ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2364, #2366).\\n\\n4.25.0 (released 2021-07-05)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [tfmLib] Added new library for parsing TeX Font Metric (TFM) files (#2354).\\n- [TupleVariation] Make shared tuples order deterministic on python < 3.7 where\\n  Counter (subclass of dict) doesn't remember insertion order (#2351, #2353).\\n- [otData] Renamed COLRv1 structs to remove 'v1' suffix and match the updated draft\\n  spec: 'LayerV1List' -> 'LayerList', 'BaseGlyphV1List' -> 'BaseGlyphList',\\n  'BaseGlyphV1Record' -> 'BaseGlyphPaintRecord' (#2346).\\n  Added 8 new ``PaintScale*`` tables: with/without centers, uniform vs non-uniform.\\n  Added ``*AroundCenter`` variants to ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew``: the default\\n  versions no longer have centerX/Y, but default to origin.\\n  ``PaintRotate``, ``PaintSkew`` and ``PaintComposite`` formats were re-numbered.\\n  NOTE: these are breaking changes; clients using the experimental COLRv1 API will\\n  have to be updated (#2348).\\n- [pointPens] Allow ``GuessSmoothPointPen`` to accept a tolerance. Fixed call to\\n  ``math.atan2`` with x/y parameters inverted. Sync the code with fontPens (#2344).\\n- [post] Fixed parsing ``post`` table format 2.0 when it contains extra garbage\\n  at the end of the stringData array (#2314).\\n- [subset] drop empty features unless 'size' with FeatureParams table (#2324).\\n- [otlLib] Added ``otlLib.optimize`` module; added GPOS compaction algorithm.\\n  The compaction can be run on existing fonts with ``fonttools otlLib.optimize``\\n  or using the snippet ``compact_gpos.py``. There's experimental support for\\n  compacting fonts at compilation time using an environment variable, but that\\n  might be removed later (#2326).\\n\\n4.24.4 (released 2021-05-25)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset/instancer] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when instantiating a VF that\\n  contains GPOS ValueRecords with ``Device`` tables but without the respective\\n  non-Device values (e.g. ``XAdvDevice`` without ``XAdvance``). When not\\n  explicitly set, the latter are assumed to be 0 (#2323).\\n\\n4.24.3 (released 2021-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otTables] Fixed ``AttributeError`` in methods that split LigatureSubst,\\n  MultipleSubst and AlternateSubst subtables when an offset overflow occurs.\\n  The ``Format`` attribute was removed in v4.22.0 (#2319).\\n\\n4.24.2 (released 2021-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ttGlyphPen] Fixed typing annotation of TTGlyphPen glyphSet parameter (#2315).\\n- Fixed two instances of DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence (#2311).\\n\\n4.24.1 (released 2021-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fixed AttributeError when SinglePos subtable has None Value (ValueFormat 0)\\n  (#2312, #2313).\\n\\n4.24.0 (released 2021-05-17)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [pens] Add ``ttGlyphPen.TTGlyphPointPen`` similar to ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2205).\\n\\n4.23.1 (released 2021-05-14)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fix ``KeyError`` after subsetting ``COLR`` table that initially contains\\n  both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset only requested v1 glyphs; we were\\n  not pruning the v0 portion of the table (#2308).\\n- [colorLib] Set ``LayerV1List`` attribute to ``None`` when empty, it's optional\\n  in CORLv1 (#2308).\\n\\n4.23.0 (released 2021-05-13)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Allow to use ``\\\\\\\\UNC`` absolute paths on Windows (#2299, #2306).\\n- [varLib.merger] Fixed bug where ``VarLibMergeError`` was raised with incorrect\\n  parameters (#2300).\\n- [feaLib] Allow substituting a glyph class with ``NULL`` to delete multiple glyphs\\n  (#2303).\\n- [glyf] Fixed ``NameError`` exception in ``getPhantomPoints`` (#2295, #2305).\\n- [removeOverlaps] Retry pathops.simplify after rounding path coordinates to integers\\n  if it fails the first time using floats, to work around a rare and hard to debug\\n  Skia bug (#2288).\\n- [varLib] Added support for building, reading, writing and optimizing 32-bit\\n  ``ItemVariationStore`` as used in COLRv1 table (#2285).\\n- [otBase/otConverters] Add array readers/writers for int types (#2285).\\n- [feaLib] Allow more than one lookahead glyph/class in contextual positioning with\\n  \\\"value at end\\\" (#2293, #2294).\\n- [COLRv1] Default varIdx should be 0xFFFFFFFF (#2297, #2298).\\n- [pens] Make RecordingPointPen actually pass on identifiers; replace asserts with\\n  explicit ``PenError`` exception (#2284).\\n- [mutator] Round lsb for CF2 fonts as well (#2286).\\n\\n4.22.1 (released 2021-04-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Skip references to named lookups if the lookup block definition\\n  is empty, similarly to makeotf. This also fixes an ``AttributeError`` while\\n  generating ``aalt`` feature (#2276, #2277).\\n- [subset] Fixed bug with ``--no-hinting`` implementation for Device tables (#2272,\\n  #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping Device tables if no-hinting was\\n  requested, but some Device tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000) are also used to encode\\n  variation indices and need to be retained.\\n- [otBase] Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when decompiling ``MVAR``\\n  table with ``lazy=True`` (#2273, #2274).\\n- [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified ``GlyphCoordinates`` and\\n  ``TupleVariation`` classes, use ``bytearray`` where possible, refactored\\n  phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30% speedup in total time\\n  of loading master ttfs, building gvar, and saving (#2261, #2266).\\n- [subset] Fixed ``AssertionError`` while pruning unused CPAL palettes when\\n  ``0xFFFF`` is present (#2257, #2259).\\n\\n4.22.0 (released 2021-04-01)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst, LigatureSubst,\\n  AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).\\n  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!\\n- [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite as a tuple\\n  subclass (#2201).\\n- [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib (#2209).\\n- [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error accumulation from\\n  multiple deltas (#2214)\\n- [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly terms (#2223, #2226)\\n- [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)\\n- [varLib/otlLib] Allow merging into VariationFont without first saving GPOS\\n  PairPos2 (#2229)\\n- [subset] Improve PairPosFormat2 subsetting (#2221)\\n- [ttLib] TTFont.save: create file on disk as late as possible (#2253)\\n- [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators LanguageGroup and ExpansionFactor\\n  (#2249)\\n  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!\\n\\n4.21.1 (released 2021-02-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [pens] Reverted breaking change that turned ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen``\\n  into abstract base classes (#2164, #2198).\\n\\n4.21.0 (released 2021-02-26)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Indent anchor statements in ``asFea()`` to make them more legible and\\n  diff-able (#2193).\\n- [pens] Turn ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen`` into abstract base classes\\n  (#2164).\\n- [feaLib] Added support for parsing and building ``STAT`` table from AFDKO feature\\n  files (#2039).\\n- [instancer] Added option to update name table of generated instance using ``STAT``\\n  table's axis values (#2189).\\n- [bezierTools] Added functions to compute bezier point-at-time, as well as line-line,\\n  curve-line and curve-curve intersections (#2192).\\n\\n4.20.0 (released 2021-02-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [COLRv1] Added ``unbuildColrV1`` to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to raw json-able\\n  data structure; it does the reverse of ``buildColrV1`` (#2171).\\n- [feaLib] Allow ``sub X by NULL`` sequence to delete a glyph (#2170).\\n- [arrayTools] Fixed ``Vector`` division (#2173).\\n- [COLRv1] Define new ``PaintSweepGradient`` (#2172).\\n- [otTables] Moved ``Paint.Format`` enum class outside of ``Paint`` class definition,\\n  now named ``PaintFormat``. It was clashing with paint instance ``Format`` attribute\\n  and thus was breaking lazy load of COLR table which relies on magic ``__getattr__``\\n  (#2175).\\n- [COLRv1] Replace hand-coded builder functions with otData-driven dynamic\\n  implementation (#2181).\\n- [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats (#2181).\\n- [subset] Added support for subsetting COLR v1 and CPAL tables (#2174, #2177).\\n- [fontBuilder] Allow ``setupFvar`` to optionally take ``designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor``\\n  objects. Added new ``setupAvar`` method. Support localised names for axes and\\n  named instances (#2185).\\n\\n4.19.1 (released 2021-01-28)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now stays an off-curve\\n  point after compression.\\n\\n4.19.0 (released 2021-01-25)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [codecs] Handle ``errors`` parameter different from 'strict' for the custom\\n  extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).\\n- [featureVars] Raise better error message when a script is missing the required\\n  default language system (#2154).\\n- [COLRv1] Avoid abrupt change caused by rounding ``PaintRadialGradient.c0`` when\\n  the start circle almost touches the end circle's perimeter (#2148).\\n- [COLRv1] Support building unlimited lists of paints as 255-ary trees of\\n  ``PaintColrLayers`` tables (#2153).\\n- [subset] Prune redundant format-12 cmap subtables when all non-BMP characters\\n  are dropped (#2146).\\n- [basePen] Raise ``MissingComponentError`` instead of bare ``KeyError`` when a\\n  referenced component is missing (#2145).\\n\\n4.18.2 (released 2020-12-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [COLRv1] Implemented ``PaintTranslate`` paint format (#2129).\\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed unbound local variable error (#1787).\\n- [otlLib] Don't crash when creating OpenType class definitions if some glyphs\\n  occur more than once (#2125).\\n\\n4.18.1 (released 2020-12-09)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Speed optimization for ``LayerV1ListBuilder`` (#2119).\\n- [mutator] Fixed missing tab in ``interpolate_cff2_metrics`` (0957dc7a).\\n\\n4.18.0 (released 2020-12-04)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [COLRv1] Update to latest draft: added ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew`` (#2118).\\n- [woff2] Support new ``brotlicffi`` bindings for PyPy (#2117).\\n- [glifLib] Added ``expectContentsFile`` parameter to ``GlyphSet``, for use when\\n  reading existing UFOs, to comply with the specification stating that a\\n  ``contents.plist`` file must exist in a glyph set (#2114).\\n- [subset] Allow ``LangSys`` tags in ``--layout-scripts`` option (#2112). For example:\\n  ``--layout-scripts=arab.dflt,arab.URD,latn``; this will keep ``DefaultLangSys``\\n  and ``URD`` language for ``arab`` script, and all languages for ``latn`` script.\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow UFOs to be checked; report open paths, non existant\\n  glyphs; add a ``--json`` option to produce a machine-readable list of\\n  incompatibilities\\n- [pens] Added ``QuartzPen`` to create ``CGPath`` from glyph outlines on macOS.\\n  Requires pyobjc (#2107).\\n- [feaLib] You can export ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING=1`` to enable feature file\\n  debugging info stored in ``Debg`` table (#2106).\\n- [otlLib] Build more efficient format 1 and format 2 contextual lookups whenever\\n  possible (#2101).\\n\\n4.17.1 (released 2020-11-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0 when building COLR v0 table; when color\\n  layers are stored in UFO lib plist, we can't distinguish tuples from lists so\\n  we need to accept either types (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).\\n\\n4.17.0 (released 2020-11-12)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft ``COLR`` v1 spec (#2092).\\n- [svgLib] Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not separated\\n  by space or comma (#2094).\\n- [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing', if the default glyph is\\n  not empty (#2082).\\n- [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup location for ``Debg`` if ``Builder.buildLookups_``\\n  has cooperated (#2065, #2067).\\n- [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).\\n- [varLib] Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).\\n- Add HashPointPen adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of a glyph\\n  can be computed, which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).\\n\\n4.16.1 (released 2020-10-05)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib.instancer] Fixed ``TypeError`` exception when instantiating a VF with\\n  a GSUB table 1.1 in which ``FeatureVariations`` attribute is present but set to\\n  ``None`` -- indicating that optional ``FeatureVariations`` is missing (#2077).\\n- [glifLib] Make ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of the ``point`` element required\\n  even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful ``GlifLibError``\\n  message when that happens (#2075).\\n\\n4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [removeOverlaps] Added new module and ``removeOverlaps`` function that merges\\n  overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the\\n  `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.\\n  Note that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).\\n- [varLib.instancer] Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.\\n  The ``overlap`` option in ``instantiateVariableFont`` now takes an ``OverlapMode``\\n  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS, 1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2: REMOVE.\\n  The latter is equivalent to calling ``removeOverlaps`` on the generated static\\n  instance. The option continues to accept ``bool`` value for backward compatibility.\\n\\n\\n4.15.0 (released 2020-09-21)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [plistlib] Added typing annotations to plistlib module. Set up mypy static\\n  typechecker to run automatically on CI (#2061).\\n- [ttLib] Implement private ``Debg`` table, a reverse-DNS namespaced JSON dict.\\n- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the ``Debg`` table with the original\\n  lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination (if any),\\n  and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx output for\\n  a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).\\n- [sfnt] Disabled checksum checking by default in ``SFNTReader`` (#2058).\\n- [Docs] Document ``mtiLib`` module (#2027).\\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour node count and operation type\\n  of each node (#2054).\\n- [ttLib] Added API to register custom table packer/unpacker classes (#2055).\\n\\n4.14.0 (released 2020-08-19)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).\\n- [Docs] Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).\\n- [ttLib] Fixed 21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation (#2044,\\n  #2045).\\n- [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point (81d0042a).\\n- [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether the\\n  optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).\\n- [Snippets] Added snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF (#2030).\\n- [otlLib] Generate GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where appropriate\\n  (#2016).\\n\\n4.13.0 (released 2020-07-10)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib; refactored\\n  some common code (#2004, #2007).\\n- [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).\\n- [glifLib] Fixed bug with some UFO .glif filenames clashing on case-insensitive\\n  filesystems (#2001, #2002).\\n- [colorLib] Updated COLRv1 implementation following changes in the draft spec:\\n  (#2008, googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec#24).\\n\\n4.12.1 (released 2020-06-16)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed error in ``addMultilingualName`` with one-character names.\\n  Only attempt to recovered malformed UTF-16 data from a ``bytes`` string,\\n  not from unicode ``str`` (#1997, #1998).\\n\\n4.12.0 (released 2020-06-09)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [otlLib/varLib] Ensure that the ``AxisNameID`` in the ``STAT`` and ``fvar``\\n  tables is grater than 255 as per OpenType spec (#1985, #1986).\\n- [docs] Document more modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``filenames``,\\n  ``fixedTools``, ``intTools``, ``loggingTools``, ``macCreatorType``, ``macRes``,\\n  ``plistlib`` (#1981).\\n- [OS/2] Don't calculate whole sets of unicode codepoints, use faster and more memory\\n  efficient ranges and bisect lookups (#1984).\\n- [voltLib] Support writing back abstract syntax tree as VOLT data (#1983).\\n- [voltLib] Accept DO_NOT_TOUCH_CMAP keyword (#1987).\\n- [subset/merge] Fixed a namespace clash involving a private helper class (#1955).\\n\\n4.11.0 (released 2020-05-28)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Introduced ``includeDir`` parameter on Parser and IncludingLexer to\\n  explicitly specify the directory to search when ``include()`` statements are\\n  encountered (#1973).\\n- [ufoLib] Silently delete duplicate glyphs within the same kerning group when reading\\n  groups (#1970).\\n- [ttLib] Set version of COLR table when decompiling COLRv1 (commit 9d8a7e2).\\n\\n4.10.2 (released 2020-05-20)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [sfnt] Fixed ``NameError: SimpleNamespace`` while reading TTC header. The regression\\n  was introduced with 4.10.1 after removing ``py23`` star import.\\n\\n4.10.1 (released 2020-05-19)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [sfnt] Make ``SFNTReader`` pickleable even when TTFont is loaded with lazy=True\\n  option and thus keeps a reference to an external file (#1962, #1967).\\n- [feaLib.ast] Restore backward compatibility (broken in 4.10 with #1905) for\\n  ``ChainContextPosStatement`` and ``ChainContextSubstStatement`` classes.\\n  Make them accept either list of lookups or list of lists of lookups (#1961).\\n- [docs] Document some modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``arrayTools``,\\n  ``bezierTools`` ``cliTools`` and ``eexec`` (#1956).\\n- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Fixed ``findMultilingualName()`` when name record's ``string`` is\\n  encoded as bytes sequence (#1963).\\n\\n4.10.0 (released 2020-05-15)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Allow feature variations to be active across the entire space (#1957).\\n- [ufoLib] Added support for ``formatVersionMinor`` in UFO's ``fontinfo.plist`` and for\\n  ``formatMinor`` attribute in GLIF file as discussed in unified-font-object/ufo-spec#78.\\n  No changes in reading or writing UFOs until an upcoming (non-0) minor update of the\\n  UFO specification is published (#1786).\\n- [merge] Fixed merging fonts with different versions of ``OS/2`` table (#1865, #1952).\\n- [subset] Fixed ``AttributeError`` while subsetting ``ContextSubst`` and ``ContextPos``\\n  Format 3 subtable (#1879, #1944).\\n- [ttLib.table._m_e_t_a] if data happens to be ascii, emit comment in TTX (#1938).\\n- [feaLib] Support multiple lookups per glyph position (#1905).\\n- [psCharStrings] Use inheritance to avoid repeated code in initializer (#1932).\\n- [Doc] Improved documentation for the following modules: ``afmLib`` (#1933), ``agl``\\n  (#1934), ``cffLib`` (#1935), ``cu2qu`` (#1937), ``encodings`` (#1940), ``feaLib``\\n  (#1941), ``merge`` (#1949).\\n- [Doc] Split off developer-centric info to new page, making front page of docs more\\n  user-focused.

The subsetter no longer drops\\n  FeatureVariationRecords that have empty substitutions as that will keep the search\\n  going and thus change the logic. It will only drop empty records that occur at the\\n  end of the FeatureVariationRecords array (#1881).\\n- [subset] Remove FeatureVariations table and downgrade GSUB/GPOS to version 0x10000\\n  when FeatureVariations contain no FeatureVariationRecords after subsetting (#1903).\\n- [agl] Add support for legacy Adobe Glyph List of glyph names in ``fontTools.agl``\\n  (#1895).\\n- [feaLib] Ignore superfluous script statements (#1883).\\n- [feaLib] Hide traceback by default on ``fonttools feaLib`` command line.\\n  Use ``--traceback`` option to show (#1898).\\n- [feaLib] Check lookup index in chaining sub/pos lookups and print better error\\n  message (#1896, #1897).\\n- [feaLib] Fix building chained alt substitutions (#1902).\\n- [Doc] Included all fontTools modules in the sphinx-generated documentation, and\\n  published it to ReadTheDocs for continuous documentation of the fontTools project\\n  (#1333). Check it out at https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/. Thanks to Chris Simpkins!\\n- [transform] The ``Transform`` class is now subclass of ``typing.NamedTuple``. No\\n  change in functionality (#1904).\\n\\n\\n4.8.1 (released 2020-04-17)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Fixed ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' has no attribute 'getAlternateGlyphs'``\\n  when ``aalt`` feature references a chain contextual substitution lookup\\n  (googlefonts/fontmake#648, #1878).\\n\\n4.8.0 (released 2020-04-16)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] If Parser is initialized without a ``glyphNames`` parameter, it cannot\\n  distinguish between a glyph name containing an hyphen, or a range of glyph names;\\n  instead of raising an error, it now interprets them as literal glyph names, while\\n  also outputting a logging warning to alert user about the ambiguity (#1768, #1870).\\n- [feaLib] When serializing AST to string, emit spaces around hyphens that denote\\n  ranges. Also, fixed an issue with CID ranges when round-tripping AST->string->AST\\n  (#1872).\\n- [Snippets/otf2ttf] In otf2ttf.py script update LSB in hmtx to match xMin (#1873).\\n- [colorLib] Added experimental support for building ``COLR`` v1 tables as per\\n  the `colr-gradients-spec <https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/blob/main/colr-gradients-spec.md>`__\\n  draft proposal. **NOTE**: both the API and the XML dump of ``COLR`` v1 are\\n  susceptible to change while the proposal is being discussed and formalized (#1822).\\n\\n4.7.0 (released 2020-04-03)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [cu2qu] Added ``fontTools.cu2qu`` package, imported from the original\\n  `cu2qu <https://github.com/googlefonts/cu2qu>`__ project. The ``cu2qu.pens`` module\\n  was moved to ``fontTools.pens.cu2quPen``. The optional cu2qu extension module\\n  can be compiled by installing `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__ before installing\\n  fonttools from source (i.e. git repo or sdist tarball). The wheel package that\\n  is published on PyPI (i.e. the one ``pip`` downloads, unless ``--no-binary``\\n  option is used), will continue to be pure-Python for now (#1868).\\n\\n4.6.0 (released 2020-03-24)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Added support for building variable ``BASE`` table version 1.1 (#1858).\\n- [CPAL] Added ``fromRGBA`` method to ``Color`` class (#1861).\\n\\n\\n4.5.0 (released 2020-03-20)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [designspaceLib] Added ``add{Axis,Source,Instance,Rule}Descriptor`` methods to\\n  ``DesignSpaceDocument`` class, to initialize new descriptor objects using keyword\\n  arguments, and at the same time append them to the current document (#1860).\\n- [unicodedata] Update to Unicode 13.0 (#1859).\\n\\n4.4.3 (released 2020-03-13)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [varLib] Always build ``gvar`` table for TrueType-flavored Variable Fonts,\\n  even if it contains no variation data. The table is required according to\\n  the OpenType spec (#1855, #1857).\\n\\n4.4.2 (released 2020-03-12)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [ttx] Annotate ``LookupFlag`` in XML dump with comment explaining what bits\\n  are set and what they mean (#1850).\\n- [feaLib] Added more descriptive message to ``IncludedFeaNotFound`` error (#1842).\\n\\n4.4.1 (released 2020-02-26)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [woff2] Skip normalizing ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables if these are missing from\\n  a font (e.g. in NotoColorEmoji using ``CBDT/CBLC`` tables).\\n- [timeTools] Use non-localized date parsing in ``timestampFromString``, to fix\\n  error when non-English ``LC_TIME`` locale is set (#1838, #1839).\\n- [fontBuilder] Make sure the CFF table generated by fontBuilder can be used by varLib\\n  without having to compile and decompile the table first. This was breaking in\\n  converting the CFF table to CFF2 due to some unset attributes (#1836).\\n\\n4.4.0 (released 2020-02-18)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [colorLib] Added ``fontTools.colorLib.builder`` module, initially with ``buildCOLR``\\n  and ``buildCPAL`` public functions. More color font formats will follow (#1827).\\n- [fontBuilder] Added ``setupCOLR`` and ``setupCPAL`` methods (#1826).\\n- [ttGlyphPen] Quantize ``GlyphComponent.transform`` floats to ``F2Dot14`` to fix\\n  round-trip issue when computing bounding boxes of transformed components (#1830).\\n- [glyf] If a component uses reference points (``firstPt`` and ``secondPt``) for\\n  alignment (instead of X and Y offsets), compute the effective translation offset\\n  *after* having applied any transform (#1831).\\n- [glyf] When all glyphs have zero contours, compile ``glyf`` table data as a single\\n  null byte in order to pass validation by OTS and Windows (#1829).\\n- [feaLib] Parsing feature code now ensures that referenced glyph names are part of\\n  the known glyph set, unless a glyph set was not provided.\\n- [varLib] When filling in the default axis value for a missing location of a source or\\n  instance, correctly map the value forward.\\n- [varLib] The avar table can now contain mapping output values that are greater than\\n  OR EQUAL to the preceeding value, as the avar specification allows this.\\n- [varLib] The errors of the module are now ordered hierarchically below VarLibError.\\n  See #1821.\\n\\n4.3.0 (released 2020-02-03)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [EBLC/CBLC] Fixed incorrect padding length calculation for Format 3 IndexSubTable\\n  (#1817, #1818).\\n- [varLib] Fixed error when merging OTL tables and TTFonts were loaded as ``lazy=True``\\n  (#1808, #1809).\\n- [varLib] Allow to use master fonts containing ``CFF2`` table when building VF (#1816).\\n- [ttLib] Make ``recalcBBoxes`` option work also with ``CFF2`` table (#1816).\\n- [feaLib] Don't reset ``lookupflag`` in lookups defined inside feature blocks.\\n  They will now inherit the current ``lookupflag`` of the feature. This is what\\n  Adobe ``makeotf`` also does in this case (#1815).\\n- [feaLib] Fixed bug with mixed single/multiple substitutions. If a single substitution\\n  involved a glyph class, we were incorrectly using only the first glyph in the class\\n  (#1814).\\n\\n4.2.5 (released 2020-01-29)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [feaLib] Do not fail on duplicate multiple substitutions, only warn (#1811).\\n- [subset] Optimize SinglePos subtables to Format 1 if all ValueRecords are the same\\n  (#1802).\\n\\n4.2.4 (released 2020-01-09)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [unicodedata] Update RTL_SCRIPTS for Unicode 11 and 12.\\n\\n4.2.3 (released 2020-01-07)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [otTables] Fixed bug when splitting `MarkBasePos` subtables as offsets overflow.\\n  The mark class values in the split subtable were not being updated, leading to\\n  invalid mark-base attachments (#1797, googlefonts/noto-source#145).\\n- [feaLib] Only log a warning instead of error when features contain duplicate\\n  substitutions (#1767).\\n- [glifLib] Strip XML comments when parsing with lxml (#1784, #1785).\\n\\n4.2.2 (released 2019-12-12)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [subset] Fixed issue with subsetting FeatureVariations table when the index\\n  of features changes as features get dropped. The feature index need to be\\n  remapped to point to index of the remaining features (#1777, #1782).\\n- [fontBuilder] Added `addFeatureVariations` method to `FontBuilder` class. This\\n  is a shorthand for calling `featureVars.addFeatureVariations` on the builder's\\n  TTFont object (#1781).\\n- [glyf] Fixed the flags bug in glyph.drawPoints() like we did for glyph.draw()\\n  (#1771, #1774).\\n\\n4.2.1 (released 2019-12-06)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [glyf] Use the ``flagOnCurve`` bit mask in ``glyph.draw()``, so that we ignore\\n  the ``overlap`` flag that may be set when instantiating variable fonts (#1771).\\n\\n4.2.0 (released 2019-11-28)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [pens] Added the following pens:\\n\\n  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPen``: filter pen that rounds coordinates and components'\\n    offsets to integer;\\n  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPointPen``: like the above, but using PointPen protocol.\\n  * ``filterPen.FilterPointPen``: base class for filter point pens;\\n  * ``transformPen.TransformPointPen``: filter point pen to apply affine transform;\\n  * ``recordingPen.RecordingPointPen``: records and replays point-pen commands.\\n\\n- [ttGlyphPen] Always round float coordinates and component offsets to integers\\n  (#1763).\\n- [ufoLib] When converting kerning groups from UFO2 to UFO3, avoid confusing\\n  groups with the same name as one of the glyphs (#1761, #1762,\\n  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#98).\\n\\n4.1.0 (released 2019-11-18)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [instancer] Implemented restricting axis ranges (level 3 partial instancing).\\n  You can now pass ``{axis_tag: (min, max)}`` tuples as input to the\\n  ``instantiateVariableFont`` function. Note that changing the default axis\\n  position is not supported yet. The command-line script also accepts axis ranges\\n  in the form of colon-separated float values, e.g. ``wght=400:700`` (#1753, #1537).\\n- [instancer] Never drop STAT ``DesignAxis`` records, but only prune out-of-range\\n  ``AxisValue`` records.\\n- [otBase/otTables] Enforce that VarStore.RegionAxisCount == fvar.axisCount, even\\n  when regions list is empty to appease OTS < v8.0 (#1752).\\n- [designspaceLib] Defined new ``processing`` attribute for ``<rules>`` element,\\n  with values \\\"first\\\" or \\\"last\\\", plus other editorial changes to DesignSpace\\n  specification. Bumped format version to 4.1 (#1750).\\n- [varLib] Improved error message when masters' glyph orders do not match (#1758,\\n  #1759).\\n- [featureVars] Allow to specify custom feature tag in ``addFeatureVariations``;\\n  allow said feature to already exist, in which case we append new lookup indices\\n  to existing features. Implemented ``<rules>`` attribute ``processing`` according to\\n  DesignSpace specification update in #1750. Depending on this flag, we generate\\n  either an 'rvrn' (always processed first) or a 'rclt' feature (follows lookup order,\\n  therefore last) (#1747, #1625, #1371).\\n- [ttCollection] Added support for context manager auto-closing via ``with`` statement\\n  like with ``TTFont`` (#1751).\\n- [unicodedata] Require unicodedata2 >= 12.1.0.\\n- [py2.py3] Removed yet more PY2 vestiges (#1743).\\n- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed issue when comparing NameRecords with different string types (#1742).\\n- [fixedTools] Changed ``fixedToFloat`` to not do any rounding but simply return\\n  ``value / (1 << precisionBits)``. Added ``floatToFixedToStr`` and\\n  ``strToFixedToFloat`` functions to be used when loading from or dumping to XML.\\n  Fixed values (e.g. fvar axes and instance coordinates, avar mappings, etc.) are\\n  are now stored as un-rounded decimal floats upon decompiling (#1740, #737).\\n- [feaLib] Fixed handling of multiple ``LigatureCaret`` statements for the same glyph.\\n  Only the first rule per glyph is used, additional ones are ignored (#1733).\\n\\n4.0.2 (released 2019-09-26)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [voltLib] Added support for ``ALL`` and ``NONE`` in ``PROCESS_MARKS`` (#1732).\\n- [Silf] Fixed issue in ``Silf`` table compilation and decompilation regarding str vs\\n  bytes in python3 (#1728).\\n- [merge] Handle duplicate glyph names better: instead of appending font index to\\n  all glyph names, use similar code like we use in ``post`` and ``CFF`` tables (#1729).\\n\\n4.0.1 (released 2019-09-11)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- [otTables] Support fixing offset overflows in ``MultipleSubst`` lookup subtables\\n  (#1706).\\n- [subset] Prune empty strikes in ``EBDT`` and ``CBDT`` table data (#1698, #1633).\\n- [pens] Fixed issue in ``PointToSegmentPen`` when last point of closed contour has\\n  same coordinates as the starting point and was incorrectly dropped (#1720).\\n- [Graphite] Fixed ``Sill`` table output to pass OTS (#1705).\\n- [name] Added ``removeNames`` method to ``table__n_a_m_e`` class (#1719).\\n- [ttLib] Added aliases for renamed entries ``ascender`` and ``descender`` in\\n  ``hhea`` table (#1715).\\n\\n4.0.0 (released 2019-08-22)\\n---------------------------\\n\\n- NOTE: The v4.x version series only supports Python 3.6 or greater. You can keep\\n  using fonttools 3.x if you need support for Python 2.\\n- [py23] Removed all the python2-only code since it is no longer reachable, thus\\n  unused; only the Python3 symbols were kept, but these are no-op. The module is now\\n  DEPRECATED and will removed in the future.\\n- [ttLib] Fixed UnboundLocalError for empty loca/glyph tables (#1680). Also, allow\\n  the glyf table to be incomplete when dumping to XML (#1681).\\n- [varLib.models] Fixed KeyError while sorting masters and there are no on-axis for\\n  a given axis (38a8eb0e).\\n- [cffLib] Make sure glyph names are unique (#1699).\\n- [feaLib] Fix feature parser to correctly handle octal numbers (#1700).\\n\\n\\\\... see `here <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/main/NEWS.rst>`__ for earlier changes\\n\",\n",

Acknowledgements and Thanks\\n\\n\\n1. Licensing\\n============\\nBSD license.  See ``LICENSE.txt`` for details.\\n\\n\\n2. Installation\\n===============\\n\\nIn most cases, pip install reportlab`` will do the job.\\n\\n\\n2.1 General prerequisites\\n--------------------------\\nYou need to have installed Python (versions 2.7 or >=3.6) and reportlab\\nand ideally PIL or Pillow with Freetype support; more notes on prerequisites\\nfollow below.\\n\\n2.2. Where to get the code\\n------------------------------------------\\nLatest sources are available from ReportLab's\\nopen source download area::\\n\\n    https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-pulic/rlPyCairo\\n\\nYou can obtain the latest code from our Mercurial repository with::\\n\\n    hg clone https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-public/rlPyCairo\\n\\nAll released packages are available from our pypi at\\n\\n\\thttps://www.reportlab.com/pypi/\\n\\n\\nMain releases are also available from the Python Package Index:\\n\\n    https://pypi.python.org/\\n\\nA mirror only repository is available for git users at\\n\\n\\thttps://github.com/MrBitBucket/rlPyCairo-mirror\\n\\nplease do not use this for issue reporting etc; use the mail list at\\n\\n    https://pairlist2.pair.net/mailman/listinfo/reportlab-users\\n\\n\\n3. Prerequisites / Dependencies\\n===============================\\nThis works with Python versions 2.7 or >=3.6. Older versions are available\\ngoing back to Python 1.5 or thereabouts.\\n\\nThere are no absolute prerequisites beyond the Python\\nstandard library; but the Python Imaging Library (PIL or Pillow)\\nis needed to produce images with this package.\\n\\n4. Documentation\\n================\\nThere is no documentation other than that provided in the reportlab package\\nabout the standard renderPM renderer. This package is intended as an\\nalternative to the lgpl_libart based backend reportlab.graphics._renderPM.\\n\\nTo enable this backend the reportlab.rl_config.renderPMBackend should be set\\nto the string 'rlPyCairo'. Use any of the methods outlined in\\nreportlab/rl_config.py to accomplish this.\\n\\n5. Test suite\\n=============\\nTests are in the ``reportlab/tests/`` directory.  They can be executed by cd'ing into the\\ndirectory and executing ``python runAll.py`` with an envinment variable\\nset as RL_renderPMBackend=rlPyCairo. Obviously you need to have rlPyCairo\\ninstalled.\\n\\n6. Acknowledgements and Thanks\\n==============================\\nClaude Paroz for failing examples of the base backend.\\n\",\n",

You can remove it from your requirements file if none of your other\\n  requirements require html5lib.\\n\\n  This means Bleach will now work fine with other libraries that depend on\\n  html5lib regardless of what version of html5lib they require. (#386)\\n\\n**Bug fixes**\\n\\n* Fixed tags getting added when using clean or linkify. This was a\\n  long-standing regression from the Bleach 2.0 rewrite. (#280, #392)\\n\\n* Fixed ``<isindex>`` getting replaced with a string. Now it gets escaped or\\n  stripped depending on whether it's in the allowed tags or not.

Using character entities, it\\n  was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not\\n  allowed that would slide through unsanitized.\\n\\n  This security issue was introduced in Bleach 2.1.

Check the comments on that\\n  issue for ways to alleviate the issue if you can't upgrade to Bleach 2.1.\\n\\n\\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\\n\\n* Redid versioning. ``bleach.VERSION`` is no longer available. Use the string\\n  version at ``bleach.__version__`` and parse it with\\n  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. (#307)\\n\\n* clean, linkify: linkify and clean should only accept text types; thank you,\\n  Janusz!

(#206)\\n\\n* Removed support for Python 3.2. (#224)\\n\\n* Bleach no longer supports html5lib < 0.99999999 (8 9s).\\n\\n  This version is a rewrite to use the new sanitizing API since the old\\n  one was dropped in html5lib 0.99999999 (8 9s).\\n\\n  If you're using 0.9999999 (7 9s) upgrade to 0.99999999 (8 9s) or higher.\\n\\n  If you're using 1.0b8 (equivalent to 0.9999999 (7 9s)), upgrade to 1.0b9\\n  (equivalent to 0.99999999 (8 9s)) or higher.\\n\\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends were rewritten\\n\\n  ``clean`` was reimplemented as an html5lib filter and happens at a different\\n  step in the HTML parsing -> traversing -> serializing process. Because of\\n  that, there are some differences in clean's output as compared with previous\\n  versions.\\n\\n  Amongst other things, this version will add end tags even if the tag in\\n  question is to be escaped.\\n\\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends attribute callables now take three arguments:\\n  tag, attribute name and attribute value. Previously they only took attribute\\n  name and attribute value.\\n\\n  All attribute callables will need to be updated.\\n\\n* ``bleach.linkify`` was rewritten\\n\\n  ``linkify`` was reimplemented as an html5lib Filter. As such, it no longer\\n  accepts a ``tokenizer`` argument.\\n\\n  The callback functions for adjusting link attributes now takes a namespaced\\n  attribute.\\n\\n  Previously you'd do something like this::\\n\\n      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):\\n          if not attrs.get('href', '').startswith('http:', 'https:')):\\n              return None\\n          return attrs\\n\\n  Now it's more like this::\\n\\n      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):\\n          if not attrs.get((None, u'href'), u'').startswith(('http:', 'https:')):\\n              #            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n              return None\\n          return attrs\\n\\n  Further, you need to make sure you're always using unicode values. If you\\n  don't then html5lib will raise an assertion error that the value is not\\n  unicode.\\n\\n  All linkify filters will need to be updated.\\n\\n* ``bleach.linkify`` and friends had a ``skip_pre`` argument--that's been\\n  replaced with a more general ``skip_tags`` argument.\\n\\n  Before, you might do::\\n\\n      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_pre=True)\\n\\n  The equivalent with Bleach 2.0 is::\\n\\n      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_tags=['pre'])\\n\\n  You can skip other tags, too, like ``style`` or ``script`` or other places\\n  where you don't want linkification happening.\\n\\n  All uses of linkify that use ``skip_pre`` will need to be updated.\\n\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* Supports Python 3.6.\\n\\n* Supports html5lib >= 0.99999999 (8 9s).\\n\\n* There's a ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` class that you can instantiate with your\\n  favorite clean settings for easy reuse.\\n\\n* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.Linker`` class that you can instantiate with your\\n  favorite linkify settings for easy reuse.\\n\\n* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.LinkifyFilter`` which is an htm5lib filter that\\n  you can pass as a filter to ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` allowing you to clean\\n  and linkify in one pass.\\n\\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends can now take a callable as an attributes arg value.\\n\\n* Tons of bug fixes.\\n\\n* Cleaned up tests.\\n\\n* Documentation fixes.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.5 (November 4th, 2016)\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n**Security fixes**\\n\\n* None\\n\\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\\n\\n* clean: The list of ``ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS`` now defaults to http, https and\\n  mailto.\\n\\n  Previously it was a long list of protocols something like ed2k, ftp, http,\\n  https, irc, mailto, news, gopher, nntp, telnet, webcal, xmpp, callto, feed,\\n  urn, aim, rsync, tag, ssh, sftp, rtsp, afs, data. (#149)\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* clean: Added ``protocols`` to arguments list to let you override the list of\\n  allowed protocols. Thank you, Andreas Malecki! (#149)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix a bug involving periods at the end of an email address. Thank you,\\n  Lorenz Schori! (#219)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix linkification of non-ascii ports. Thank you Alexandre, Macabies!\\n  (#207)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix linkify inappropriately removing node tails when dropping nodes.\\n  (#132)\\n\\n* Fixed a test that failed periodically. (#161)\\n\\n* Switched from nose to py.test. (#204)\\n\\n* Add test matrix for all supported Python and html5lib versions. (#230)\\n\\n* Limit to html5lib ``>=0.999,!=0.9999,!=0.99999,<0.99999999`` because 0.9999\\n  and 0.99999 are busted.\\n\\n* Add support for ``python setup.py test``. (#97)\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4.3 (May 23rd, 2016)\\n------------------------------\\n\\n**Security fixes**\\n\\n* None\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* Limit to html5lib ``>=0.999,<0.99999999`` because of impending change to\\n  sanitizer api. #195\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4.2 (September 11, 2015)\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* linkify: Fix hang in linkify with ``parse_email=True``. (#124)\\n\\n* linkify: Fix crash in linkify when removing a link that is a first-child. (#136)\\n\\n* Updated TLDs.\\n\\n* linkify: Don't remove exterior brackets when linkifying. (#146)\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4.1 (December 15, 2014)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* Consistent order of attributes in output.\\n\\n* Python 3.4 support.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.4 (January 12, 2014)\\n------------------------------\\n\\n**Changes**\\n\\n* linkify: Update linkify to use etree type Treewalker instead of simpletree.\\n\\n* Updated html5lib to version ``>=0.999``.\\n\\n* Update all code to be compatible with Python 3 and 2 using six.\\n\\n* Switch to Apache License.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.3\\n-----------\\n\\n* Used by Python 3-only fork.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.2.2 (May 18, 2013)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n* Pin html5lib to version 0.95 for now due to major API break.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.2.1 (February 19, 2013)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n* ``clean()`` no longer considers ``feed:`` an acceptable protocol due to\\n  inconsistencies in browser behavior.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.2 (January 28, 2013)\\n------------------------------\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` has changed considerably. Many keyword arguments have been\\n  replaced with a single callbacks list. Please see the documentation for more\\n  information.\\n\\n* Bleach will no longer consider unacceptable protocols when linkifying.\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` now takes a tokenizer argument that allows it to skip\\n  sanitization.\\n\\n* ``delinkify()`` is gone.\\n\\n* Removed exception handling from ``_render``. ``clean()`` and ``linkify()`` may\\n  now throw.\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` correctly ignores case for protocols and domain names.\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` correctly handles markup within an <a> tag.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.5\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.4\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.3 (July 10, 2012)\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n* Fix parsing bare URLs when parse_email=True.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.2 (June 1, 2012)\\n----------------------------\\n\\n* Fix hang in style attribute sanitizer. (#61)\\n\\n* Allow ``/`` in style attribute values.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.1 (February 17, 2012)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n* Fix tokenizer for html5lib 0.9.5.\\n\\n\\nVersion 1.1.0 (October 24, 2011)\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n* ``linkify()`` now understands port numbers.

In some cases,\\nwe also note alternative representations which do not require this package.\\n\\n## Install\\n\\n```bash\\npip install annotated-types\\n```\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom annotated_types import Gt, Len, Predicate\\n\\nclass MyClass:\\n    age: Annotated[int, Gt(18)]                         # Valid: 19, 20, ...\\n                                                        # Invalid: 17, 18, \\\"19\\\", 19.0, ...\\n    factors: list[Annotated[int, Predicate(is_prime)]]  # Valid: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...\\n                                                        # Invalid: 4, 8, -2, 5.0, \\\"prime\\\", ...\\n\\n    my_list: Annotated[list[int], Len(0, 10)]           # Valid: [], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\\n                                                        # Invalid: (1, 2), [\\\"abc\\\"], [0] * 20\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n_While `annotated-types` avoids runtime checks for performance, users should not\\nconstruct invalid combinations such as `MultipleOf(\\\"non-numeric\\\")` or `Annotated[int, Len(3)]`.\\nDownstream implementors may choose to raise an error, emit a warning, silently ignore\\na metadata item, etc., if the metadata objects described below are used with an\\nincompatible type - or for any other reason!_\\n\\n### Gt, Ge, Lt, Le\\n\\nExpress inclusive and/or exclusive bounds on orderable values - which may be numbers,\\ndates, times, strings, sets, etc. Note that the boundary value need not be of the\\nsame type that was annotated, so long as they can be compared: `Annotated[int, Gt(1.5)]`\\nis fine, for example, and implies that the value is an integer x such that `x > 1.5`.\\n\\nWe suggest that implementors may also interpret `functools.partial(operator.le, 1.5)`\\nas being equivalent to `Gt(1.5)`, for users who wish to avoid a runtime dependency on\\nthe `annotated-types` package.\\n\\nTo be explicit, these types have the following meanings:\\n\\n* `Gt(x)` - value must be \\\"Greater Than\\\" `x` - equivalent to exclusive minimum\\n* `Ge(x)` - value must be \\\"Greater than or Equal\\\" to `x` - equivalent to inclusive minimum\\n* `Lt(x)` - value must be \\\"Less Than\\\" `x` - equivalent to exclusive maximum\\n* `Le(x)` - value must be \\\"Less than or Equal\\\" to `x` - equivalent to inclusive maximum\\n\\n### Interval\\n\\n`Interval(gt, ge, lt, le)` allows you to specify an upper and lower bound with a single\\nmetadata object. `None` attributes should be ignored, and non-`None` attributes\\ntreated as per the single bounds above.\\n\\n### MultipleOf\\n\\n`MultipleOf(multiple_of=x)` might be interpreted in two ways:\\n\\n1. Python semantics, implying `value % multiple_of == 0`, or\\n2. [JSONschema semantics](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.2.1),\\n   where `int(value / multiple_of) == value / multiple_of`.\\n\\nWe encourage users to be aware of these two common interpretations and their\\ndistinct behaviours, especially since very large or non-integer numbers make\\nit easy to cause silent data corruption due to floating-point imprecision.\\n\\nWe encourage libraries to carefully document which interpretation they implement.\\n\\n### MinLen, MaxLen, Len\\n\\n`Len()` implies that `min_length <= len(value) <= max_length` - lower and upper bounds are inclusive.\\n\\nAs well as `Len()` which can optionally include upper and lower bounds, we also\\nprovide `MinLen(x)` and `MaxLen(y)` which are equivalent to `Len(min_length=x)`\\nand `Len(max_length=y)` respectively.\\n\\n`Len`, `MinLen`, and `MaxLen` may be used with any type which supports `len(value)`.\\n\\nExamples of usage:\\n\\n* `Annotated[list, MaxLen(10)]` (or `Annotated[list, Len(max_length=10))`) - list must have a length of 10 or less\\n* `Annotated[str, MaxLen(10)]` - string must have a length of 10 or less\\n* `Annotated[list, MinLen(3))` (or `Annotated[list, Len(min_length=3))`) - list must have a length of 3 or more\\n* `Annotated[list, Len(4, 6)]` - list must have a length of 4, 5, or 6\\n* `Annotated[list, Len(8, 8)]` - list must have a length of exactly 8\\n\\n#### Changed in v0.4.0\\n\\n* `min_inclusive` has been renamed to `min_length`, no change in meaning\\n* `max_exclusive` has been renamed to `max_length`, upper bound is now **inclusive** instead of **exclusive**\\n* The recommendation that slices are interpreted as `Len` has been removed due to ambiguity and different semantic\\n  meaning of the upper bound in slices vs. `Len`\\n\\nSee [issue #23](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types/issues/23) for discussion.\\n\\n### Timezone\\n\\n`Timezone` can be used with a `datetime` or a `time` to express which timezones\\nare allowed. `Annotated[datetime, Timezone(None)]` must be a naive datetime.\\n`Timezone[...]` ([literal ellipsis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis))\\nexpresses that any timezone-aware datetime is allowed. You may also pass a specific\\ntimezone string or [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#tzinfo-objects)\\nobject such as `Timezone(timezone.utc)` or `Timezone(\\\"Africa/Abidjan\\\")` to express that you only\\nallow a specific timezone, though we note that this is often a symptom of fragile design.\\n\\n#### Changed in v0.x.x\\n\\n* `Timezone` accepts [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#tzinfo-objects) objects instead of\\n  `timezone`, extending compatibility to [`zoneinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html) and third party libraries.\\n\\n### Unit\\n\\n`Unit(unit: str)` expresses that the annotated numeric value is the magnitude of\\na quantity with the specified unit. For example, `Annotated[float, Unit(\\\"m/s\\\")]`\\nwould be a float representing a velocity in meters per second.\\n\\nPlease note that `annotated_types` itself makes no attempt to parse or validate\\nthe unit string in any way. That is left entirely to downstream libraries,\\nsuch as [`pint`](https://pint.readthedocs.io) or\\n[`astropy.units`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/).\\n\\nAn example of how a library might use this metadata:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom annotated_types import Unit\\nfrom typing import Annotated, TypeVar, Callable, Any, get_origin, get_args\\n\\n# given a type annotated with a unit:\\nMeters = Annotated[float, Unit(\\\"m\\\")]\\n\\n\\n# you can cast the annotation to a specific unit type with any\\n# callable that accepts a string and returns the desired type\\nT = TypeVar(\\\"T\\\")\\ndef cast_unit(tp: Any, unit_cls: Callable[[str], T]) -> T | None:\\n    if get_origin(tp) is Annotated:\\n        for arg in get_args(tp):\\n            if isinstance(arg, Unit):\\n                return unit_cls(arg.unit)\\n    return None\\n\\n\\n# using `pint`\\nimport pint\\npint_unit = cast_unit(Meters, pint.Unit)\\n\\n\\n# using `astropy.units`\\nimport astropy.units as u\\nastropy_unit = cast_unit(Meters, u.Unit)\\n```\\n\\n### Predicate\\n\\n`Predicate(func: Callable)` expresses that `func(value)` is truthy for valid values.\\nUsers should prefer the statically inspectable metadata above, but if you need\\nthe full power and flexibility of arbitrary runtime predicates... here it is.\\n\\nFor some common constraints, we provide generic types:\\n\\n* `IsLower       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.islower)]`\\n* `IsUpper       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.isupper)]`\\n* `IsDigit       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.isdigit)]`\\n* `IsFinite      = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isfinite)]`\\n* `IsNotFinite   = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isfinite))]`\\n* `IsNan         = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isnan)]`\\n* `IsNotNan      = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isnan))]`\\n* `IsInfinite    = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isinf)]`\\n* `IsNotInfinite = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isinf))]`\\n\\nso that you can write e.g. `x: IsFinite[float] = 2.0` instead of the longer\\n(but exactly equivalent) `x: Annotated[float, Predicate(math.isfinite)] = 2.0`.\\n\\nSome libraries might have special logic to handle known or understandable predicates,\\nfor example by checking for `str.isdigit` and using its presence to both call custom\\nlogic to enforce digit-only strings, and customise some generated external schema.\\nUsers are therefore encouraged to avoid indirection like `lambda s: s.lower()`, in\\nfavor of introspectable methods such as `str.lower` or `re.compile(\\\"pattern\\\").search`.\\n\\nTo enable basic negation of commonly used predicates like `math.isnan` without introducing introspection that makes it impossible for implementers to introspect the predicate we provide a `Not` wrapper that simply negates the predicate in an introspectable manner. Several of the predicates listed above are created in this manner.\\n\\nWe do not specify what behaviour should be expected for predicates that raise\\nan exception.  For example `Annotated[int, Predicate(str.isdigit)]` might silently\\nskip invalid constraints, or statically raise an error; or it might try calling it\\nand then propagate or discard the resulting\\n`TypeError: descriptor 'isdigit' for 'str' objects doesn't apply to a 'int' object`\\nexception.  We encourage libraries to document the behaviour they choose.\\n\\n### Doc\\n\\n`doc()` can be used to add documentation information in `Annotated`, for function and method parameters, variables, class attributes, return types, and any place where `Annotated` can be used.\\n\\nIt expects a value that can be statically analyzed, as the main use case is for static analysis, editors, documentation generators, and similar tools.\\n\\nIt returns a `DocInfo` class with a single attribute `documentation` containing the value passed to `doc()`.\\n\\nThis is the early adopter's alternative form of the [`typing-doc` proposal](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/typing-doc/typing_doc.md).\\n\\n### Integrating downstream types with `GroupedMetadata`\\n\\nImplementers may choose to provide a convenience wrapper that groups multiple pieces of metadata.\\nThis can help reduce verbosity and cognitive overhead for users.\\nFor example, an implementer like Pydantic might provide a `Field` or `Meta` type that accepts keyword arguments and transforms these into low-level metadata:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\nfrom annotated_types import GroupedMetadata, Ge\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Field(GroupedMetadata):\\n    ge: int | None = None\\n    description: str | None = None\\n\\n    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[object]:\\n        # Iterating over a GroupedMetadata object should yield annotated-types\\n        # constraint metadata objects which describe it as fully as possible,\\n        # and may include other unknown objects too.\\n        if self.ge is not None:\\n            yield Ge(self.ge)\\n        if self.description is not None:\\n            yield Description(self.description)\\n```\\n\\nLibraries consuming annotated-types constraints should check for `GroupedMetadata` and unpack it by iterating over the object and treating the results as if they had been \\\"unpacked\\\" in the `Annotated` type.  The same logic should be applied to the [PEP 646 `Unpack` type](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/), so that `Annotated[T, Field(...)]`, `Annotated[T, Unpack[Field(...)]]` and `Annotated[T, *Field(...)]` are all treated consistently.\\n\\nLibraries consuming annotated-types should also ignore any metadata they do not recongize that came from unpacking a `GroupedMetadata`, just like they ignore unrecognized metadata in `Annotated` itself.\\n\\nOur own `annotated_types.Interval` class is a `GroupedMetadata` which unpacks itself into `Gt`, `Lt`, etc., so this is not an abstract concern.  Similarly, `annotated_types.Len` is a `GroupedMetadata` which unpacks itself into `MinLen` (optionally) and `MaxLen`.\\n\\n### Consuming metadata\\n\\nWe intend to not be prescriptive as to _how_ the metadata and constraints are used, but as an example of how one might parse constraints from types annotations see our [implementation in `test_main.py`](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types/blob/f59cf6d1b5255a0fe359b93896759a180bec30ae/tests/test_main.py#L94-L103).\\n\\nIt is up to the implementer to determine how this metadata is used.\\nYou could use the metadata for runtime type checking, for generating schemas or to generate example data, amongst other use cases.\\n\\n## Design & History\\n\\nThis package was designed at the PyCon 2022 sprints by the maintainers of Pydantic\\nand Hypothesis, with the goal of making it as easy as possible for end-users to\\nprovide more informative annotations for use by runtime libraries.\\n\\nIt is deliberately minimal, and following PEP-593 allows considerable downstream\\ndiscretion in what (if anything!) they choose to support. Nonetheless, we expect\\nthat staying simple and covering _only_ the most common use-cases will give users\\nand maintainers the best experience we can. If you'd like more constraints for your\\ntypes - follow our lead, by defining them and documenting them downstream!\\n\",\n",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\\n==========================\\n\\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\\n\\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\\nsoftware.\\n\\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\\n\\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\\nthe various releases.\\n\\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\\n\\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\\n    is \\\"not incompatible\\\" with the GPL.\\n\\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\\ndirection to make these releases possible.\\n\\n\\nB.

For details on this change and migration instructions, see the [release notes](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasehistory.html#namespace-migration) of version 0.9.0.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n[Documentation](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the Open Force Field Toolkit is hosted at [readthedocs](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable). Example notebooks are available in the `examples/` directory and also hosted on the [`Open Force Field`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/en/latest/examples.html) website.\\n\\n## How to cite\\n\\nPlease cite the OpenFF Toolkit using the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/13886754) of the [latest release](https://zenodo.org/record/13886754) or the version that was used. The BibTeX reference of the latest release can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13886754/export/bibtex).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThe Open Force Field Toolkit (`openff-toolkit`) is a Python toolkit, and supports Python 3.9 through 3.11.\\n\\n### Installing via Mamba/Conda\\n\\nDetailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).\\n\\n## Force Fields\\n\\nTwo major force field development efforts have been undertaken by the Open Force Field Initiative, with results hosted in separate repositories.\\n\\n* The [Open Force Fields repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields/), which features the [Parsley](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/) and [Sage](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.0.0-release/) force field lines. These are the Open Force Field Initiative's efforts toward building _new_ force fields. The initial parameters are taken from smirnoff99Frosst, but software and data produced by the Initiative's efforts have been used to refit parameter values and add new SMIRKS-based parameters.\\n* The [smirnoff99Frosst repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/), which is descended from AMBER's parm99 force field as well as Merck-Frosst's parm@frosst. This line of force fields does not aim to alter parameter values, but is instead a test of accurately converting an atom type-based force field to the SMIRNOFF format.\\n\\nForce fields from both of these packages are available in their respective GitHub repositories and also as conda packages. Tables detailing the individual file names/versions within these force field lines are in the README of each repository. By default, installing the Open Force Field toolkit using `conda` or the single-file toolkit installers will also install these conda packages. A [plugin architecture](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/blob/main/FAQ.md#how-can-i-distribute-my-own-force-fields-in-smirnoff-format) is provided for other force field developers to produce python/conda packages that can be imported by the Open Force Field Toolkit as well.\\n\\n# Toolkit features\\n\\n## The SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format\\n\\nThis repository provides tools for using the [SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) specification](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/), which currently supports an XML representation for force field definition files.\\n\\nBy convention, files containing [XML representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) of SMIRNOFF force fields carry `.offxml` extensions.\\n\\nExample SMIRNOFF `.offxml` force field definitions can be found in [`openff/toolkit/data/test_forcefields/`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/tree/main/openff/toolkit/data/test_forcefields). These force fields are for testing only, and we neither record versions of these files, nor do we guarantee their correctness or completeness.\\n\\n### Working with SMIRNOFF parameter sets\\n\\nSMIRNOFF force fields can be parsed by the `ForceField` class, which offers methods including `create_openmm_system` for exporting to OpenMM and `create_interchange` for exporting to other formats (GROMACS, Amber, LAMMPS) via [Interchange](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/interchange).\\n\\n```python\\n# Load a molecule into the OpenFF Molecule object\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Molecule\\nfrom openff.toolkit.utils import get_data_file_path\\nsdf_file_path = get_data_file_path('molecules/ethanol.sdf')\\nmolecule = Molecule.from_file(sdf_file_path)\\n\\n# Create an OpenFF Topology object from the molecule\\nfrom openff.toolkit import Topology\\ntopology = Topology.from_molecules(molecule)\\n\\n# Load the latest OpenFF force field release: version 2.1.0, codename \\\"Sage\\\"\\nfrom openff.toolkit import ForceField\\nforcefield = ForceField('openff-2.1.0.offxml')\\n\\n# Create an OpenMM system representing the molecule with SMIRNOFF-applied parameters\\nopenmm_system = forcefield.create_openmm_system(topology)\\n\\n# Create an Interchange object for representations in other formats\\ninterchange = forcefield.create_interchange(topology)\\n```\\n\\nDetailed examples of using SMIRNOFF with the toolkit can be found [in the documentation](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html).\\n\\n# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\\n\\nSee [`FAQ.md`](FAQ.md) for answers to a variety of common problems, such as:\\n* Why do I need to provide molecules corresponding to the components of my system, or a `Topology` with bond orders?\\n* Can I use an Amber, CHARMM, or GROMACS topology/coordinate file as a starting point for applying a SMIRNOFF force field?\\n* What if I am starting from a PDB file?\\n\\n# Contributors\\n\\nFor a partial list of contributors, see the [GitHub Contributors page](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/graphs/contributors).

This makes\\nreading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and consistent\\nsemantics.\\n\\nCompatibility\\n=============\\n\\nNew features are introduced in this third-party library and later merged\\ninto CPython. The following table indicates which versions of this library\\nwere contributed to different versions in the standard library:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - importlib_resources\\n     - stdlib\\n   * - 6.0\\n     - 3.13\\n   * - 5.12\\n     - 3.12\\n   * - 5.7\\n     - 3.11\\n   * - 5.0\\n     - 3.10\\n   * - 1.3\\n     - 3.9\\n   * - 0.5 (?)\\n     - 3.7\\n\\nFor Enterprise\\n==============\\n\\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\\n\\nThis project and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.\\n\\n`Learn more <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-importlib-resources?utm_source=pypi-importlib-resources&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github>`_.\\n\",\n",

This can be used by applications that subclassed `NotebookApp` to leverage the Python server backend of Jupyter Notebooks. Such extensions should *now* switch to `ExtensionApp` API in Jupyter Server and add `NotebookConfigShimMixin` in their inheritance list to properly handle moved traits.\\n\\nFor example, an application class that previously looked like:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom notebook.notebookapp import NotebookApp\\n\\nclass MyApplication(NotebookApp):\\n```\\n\\nshould switch to look something like:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom jupyter_server.extension.application import ExtensionApp\\nfrom notebook_shim.shim import NotebookConfigShimMixin\\n\\nclass MyApplication(NotebookConfigShimMixin, ExtensionApp):\\n```\",\n",

It provides access\\nto low level APIs for WebSockets. websocket-client implements version\\n[hybi-13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-13)\\nof the WebSocket protocol. This client does not currently support the\\npermessage-deflate extension from\\n[RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThis project's documentation can be found at\\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/)\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nPlease see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can use `pip install websocket-client` to install, or `pip install -e .`\\nto install from a local copy of the code. This module is tested on Python 3.8+.\\n\\nThere are several optional dependencies that can be installed to enable\\nspecific websocket-client features.\\n- To install `python-socks` for proxy usage and `wsaccel` for a minor performance boost, use:\\n `pip install websocket-client[optional]`\\n- To install `websockets` to run unit tests using the local echo server, use:\\n `pip install websocket-client[test]`\\n- To install `Sphinx` and `sphinx_rtd_theme` to build project documentation, use:\\n `pip install websocket-client[docs]`\\n\\nWhile not a strict dependency, [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)\\nis useful when using `run_forever` with automatic reconnect. Install rel with `pip install rel`.\\n\\nFootnote: Some shells, such as zsh, require you to escape the `[` and `]` characters with a `\\\\`.\\n\\n## Usage Tips\\n\\nCheck out the documentation's FAQ for additional guidelines:\\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)\\n\\nKnown issues with this library include lack of WebSocket Compression\\nsupport (RFC 7692) and [minimal threading documentation/support](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/threading.html).\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nThe `send` and `validate_utf8` methods can sometimes be bottleneck.\\nYou can disable UTF8 validation in this library (and receive a\\nperformance enhancement) with the `skip_utf8_validation` parameter.\\nIf you want to get better performance, install wsaccel. While\\nwebsocket-client does not depend on wsaccel, it will be used if\\navailable. wsaccel doubles the speed of UTF8 validation and\\noffers a very minor 10% performance boost when masking the\\npayload data as part of the `send` process. Numpy used to\\nbe a suggested performance enhancement alternative, but\\n[issue #687](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues/687)\\nfound it didn't help.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nMany more examples are found in the\\n[examples documentation](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).\\n\\n### Long-lived Connection\\n\\nMost real-world WebSockets situations involve longer-lived connections.\\nThe WebSocketApp `run_forever` loop will automatically try to reconnect\\nto an open WebSocket connection when a network\\nconnection is lost if it is provided with:\\n\\n- a `dispatcher` argument (async dispatcher like rel or pyevent)\\n- a non-zero `reconnect` argument (delay between disconnection and attempted reconnection)\\n\\n`run_forever` provides a variety of event-based connection controls\\nusing callbacks like `on_message` and `on_error`.\\n`run_forever` **does not automatically reconnect** if the server\\ncloses the WebSocket gracefully (returning\\n[a standard websocket close code](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html#section-7.4.1)).\\n[This is the logic](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/pull/838#issuecomment-1228454826) behind the decision.\\nCustomizing behavior when the server closes\\nthe WebSocket should be handled in the `on_close` callback.\\nThis example uses [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)\\nfor the dispatcher to provide automatic reconnection.\\n\\n```python\\nimport websocket\\nimport _thread\\nimport time\\nimport rel\\n\\ndef on_message(ws, message):\\n    print(message)\\n\\ndef on_error(ws, error):\\n    print(error)\\n\\ndef on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):\\n    print(\\\"### closed ###\\\")\\n\\ndef on_open(ws):\\n    print(\\\"Opened connection\\\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    websocket.enableTrace(True)\\n    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(\\\"wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD\\\",\\n                              on_open=on_open,\\n                              on_message=on_message,\\n                              on_error=on_error,\\n                              on_close=on_close)\\n\\n    ws.run_forever(dispatcher=rel, reconnect=5)  # Set dispatcher to automatic reconnection, 5 second reconnect delay if connection closed unexpectedly\\n    rel.signal(2, rel.abort)  # Keyboard Interrupt\\n    rel.dispatch()\\n```\\n\\n### Short-lived Connection\\n\\nThis is if you want to communicate a short message and disconnect\\nimmediately when done. For example, if you want to confirm that a WebSocket\\nserver is running and responds properly to a specific request.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom websocket import create_connection\\n\\nws = create_connection(\\\"ws://echo.websocket.events/\\\")\\nprint(ws.recv())\\nprint(\\\"Sending 'Hello, World'...\\\")\\nws.send(\\\"Hello, World\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Sent\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Receiving...\\\")\\nresult =  ws.recv()\\nprint(\\\"Received '%s'\\\" % result)\\nws.close()\\n```\\n\",\n",
